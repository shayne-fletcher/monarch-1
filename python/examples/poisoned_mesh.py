"""Poisoned Mesh
================

Spawns a mesh of workers across multiple procs, then deliberately
crashes one worker. The failure poisons its proc (no new spawns
accepted), while sibling procs remain healthy. The mesh stays up
so the admin TUI can inspect the post-mortem state:

- The failed actor's ``FailureInfo`` (error message, root cause,
  timestamp, ``is_propagated``).
- The poisoned proc's ``is_poisoned=true`` and ``failed_actor_count``.
- Healthy procs and running actors for contrast.

Usage::

    buck2 run fbcode//monarch/python/examples:poisoned_mesh -- --procs 3

Then, in another terminal::

    buck2 run fbcode//monarch/hyperactor_mesh_admin_tui:hyperactor_mesh_admin_tui -- --addr <addr>

where ``<addr>`` is the address printed by the example.
