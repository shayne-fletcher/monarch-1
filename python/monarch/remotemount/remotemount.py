# larger = fewer per-chunk messages (serialization + hyperactor routing + TLS
# records). At the default 128 streams, sweeping this over a 64 MiB block puts the
# knee at 64 KiB (1024 chunks, 8 per stream): the cold-import ship fell ~60 -> 41s
# (116 blocks) vs 512 KiB, and below 64 KiB per-chunk overhead (~2048 msgs/block at
# 32 KiB) overtakes the gain. Validated as the default across 1..1024 hosts.

# transport has no dial, so it takes no stream count), so one value tunes the chain; the Rust ``NUM_CBC_STREAMS`` pyo3 default is only the fallback for
# callers that omit the argument (this path always passes it explicitly). More
# streams fill a fatter cross-DC pipe (N congestion windows summing toward the
# bandwidth-delay product), fewer cut per-stream ramp overhead. 128 is the measured
# default: raising 32 -> 128 shaved >10s off the single-host deliver wall. 256 is a
# hard ceiling -- that many concurrent TLS handshakes overrun a single worker's
# accept path (connection resets -> block reassembly fails -> supervision death) --
