# Worker-process fork invariants:
#
# `fork()` copies a process's Python objects, locks and file descriptors into
# the child, but only the calling thread survives: actor event-loop threads and
# Tokio workers do not. Before `os.fork()` returns in the child, CPython's child
# prologue clears the vanished threads' states, which can run destructors, and
# runs `os.register_at_fork(after_in_child=...)` hooks. These rules apply to a
# process after it calls `start_worker_loop_forever`, `run_worker_loop_forever`
# or `run_worker_loop_until_shutdown`, to procs started by native
# `bootstrap_main()`, and to forks from actor code in any process. In a client
# process the CF-* rules in `actor_mesh.py` also apply.
#
# WF-1 (process-state-is-pid-owned): state created by `prepare_worker_loop()`,
#   native `bootstrap_main()` or a Monarch actor loop belongs to the PID that
#   started it.
# WF-2 (inherited-state-is-unusable): a child forked after WF-1 begins must not
#   drive or finalize inherited Monarch process state. An unenforced caller
#   obligation.
# WF-3 (fork-site-hard-boundary): the child never returns or suspends into
#   copied code: after `os.fork()` its branch runs to `os._exit()` or
#   `os.exec*()`. Before that it may make ordinary calls that do not touch
#   inherited state, including `asyncio.run()` on a fresh loop under asyncio's
#   default event-loop policy, whose after-fork hook resets the copied loop
#   state; a caller-installed policy is outside this. Importing a not-yet-loaded
#   module or logging can reach inherited locks, hooks or Monarch handlers.
#   `exec` closes only `CLOEXEC` descriptors, so an adopted worker listener can
#   stay open in the new image. An unenforced caller obligation, witnessed by
#   `test_worker_fork_contract.py`.
# WF-4 (parent-stays-usable): on the WF-3 path, Monarch-owned objects released by
#   the child prologue and Monarch's own child hooks leave the parent's actor-loop
#   wakeups, executor, Tokio reactor, transports and worker service usable.
#   Caller hooks that touch inherited state are outside this guarantee.
#   Witnessed by `test_worker_fork_contract.py`.
# WF-5 (no-recovery): nothing resets, reconstructs, takes over or cleans up
#   inherited worker state, and normal interpreter exit in the child is
#   unsupported.

    """Start a Monarch server and return an observer of its lifetime.

    Starting the server is committed before this function returns, and the work
    continues if the returned Future is discarded. Call ``get()`` to block until
    it fails or shuts down.

    ``address`` accepts either of these string formats:

    - A ZMQ-style channel URL. This uses the legacy ``service`` proc identity.
    - A ProcAddr in ``<proc-id>@<channel-url>`` form. This uses the embedded
      proc identity. An explicit legacy address such as
      ``service@tcp://host:4444`` is equivalent to the bare channel URL.

    Channel URL examples:

        tcp://*:4444 - listen on tcp port (NYI, use tls on connection when ca="trust_all_connections")
        metatls://*:4444 - listen on tcp port use ssl encryption via metatls
        ipc://some_unique_string - unix sockets
        inproc://3423 - connection only accessible within the process

    A ProcAddr example:

        service<2MuAHeDjLCEd>@tcp://worker-fqdn:4444

    To bind to one interface but advertise a different one, append the bind
    address after ``@``:

        tcp://worker-fqdn:4444@tcp://0.0.0.0:4444

    The server binds to ``tcp://0.0.0.0:4444`` so any local interface can
    accept connections (e.g. ``localhost`` for ``kubectl port-forward``)
    while peers still address the worker by its routable FQDN. Without the
    ``@``-suffix, bind address equals advertised address. The ``@`` form is
    only for serving: after the worker starts, its host identity is the
    advertised address to the left of ``@``.

    The bind alias can also be used inside a ProcAddr:

        service<2MuAHeDjLCEd>@tcp://worker-fqdn:4444@tcp://0.0.0.0:4444

    The server will accept a connection to a new root client and enable it to
    use this machine as a host. If the client disconnects or cannot be contacted, this server
    kills all the current work and waits for a new connection.

    private_key is a tls private key file loaded as bytes used to establish secure connections.
    Things connecting to this machine must trust this private_key in the certificate authority file.

    ca is a certificate authority key file. This worker will only trust incoming connections with
    keys that are trusted by the ca.

    We can defer implementing authentication for a bit, but for any open source release, anyone
    is going to worry about worker machines opening unencrypted ports and waiting for connections
    on a service that evals python code, so we should just build it in.

    A child forked from this process after this call must not return or await
    into the copied event loop; it must end in ``os._exit()`` or
    ``os.exec*()``, and under asyncio's default event-loop policy may run a
    fresh loop with ``asyncio.run()`` first (WF-3 in
    ``monarch/_src/actor/bootstrap.py``).

    Create a host mesh that is connected to the list of workers
    (it starts a single dimensional mesh of 'workers' and can be reshaped).

    This returns the host mesh immediately, and allows the logic for the hosts to
    connect to happen asynchronously. A separate future such as `await mesh.initialized` is
    used to decide if we have successfully connected to all hosts. Workers may
    be strings or monarch.actor.Future objects that resolve to strings.

    Each worker string accepts either of these formats:

    - A ZMQ-style channel URL such as ``tcp://worker-fqdn:4444``. This uses the
      legacy ``service`` proc identity.
    - A ProcAddr in ``<proc-id>@<location>`` form, such as
      ``service<2MuAHeDjLCEd>@tcp://worker-fqdn:4444``. This preserves the
      embedded service proc identity and full location.

    ``attach_to_workers`` treats it as a reference to an already-serving
    worker. Dialing uses ``dial_to``; ``bind_to`` remains a serve-side detail.
