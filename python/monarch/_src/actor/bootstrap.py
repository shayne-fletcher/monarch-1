    """Start a Monarch server and return an observer of its lifetime.

    Starting the server is committed before this function returns, and the work
    continues if the returned Future is discarded. Call ``get()`` to block until
    it fails or shuts down.

    ``address`` accepts either of these string formats:

    - A ZMQ-style channel URL. This uses the legacy ``service`` proc identity.
    - A ProcAddr in ``<proc-id>@<channel-url>`` form. This uses the embedded
      proc identity. An explicit legacy address such as
      ``service@tcp://host:4444`` is equivalent to the bare channel URL.

    Channel URL examples:

        tcp://*:4444 - listen on tcp port (NYI, use tls on connection when ca="trust_all_connections")
        metatls://*:4444 - listen on tcp port use ssl encryption via metatls
        ipc://some_unique_string - unix sockets
        inproc://3423 - connection only accessible within the process

    A ProcAddr example:

        service<2MuAHeDjLCEd>@tcp://worker-fqdn:4444

    To bind to one interface but advertise a different one, append the bind
    address after ``@``:

        tcp://worker-fqdn:4444@tcp://0.0.0.0:4444

    The server binds to ``tcp://0.0.0.0:4444`` so any local interface can
    accept connections (e.g. ``localhost`` for ``kubectl port-forward``)
    while peers still address the worker by its routable FQDN. Without the
    ``@``-suffix, bind address equals advertised address. The ``@`` form is
    only for serving: after the worker starts, its host identity is the
    advertised address to the left of ``@``.

    The bind alias can also be used inside a ProcAddr:

        service<2MuAHeDjLCEd>@tcp://worker-fqdn:4444@tcp://0.0.0.0:4444

    The server will accept a connection to a new root client and enable it to
    use this machine as a host. If the client disconnects or cannot be contacted, this server
    kills all the current work and waits for a new connection.

    private_key is a tls private key file loaded as bytes used to establish secure connections.
    Things connecting to this machine must trust this private_key in the certificate authority file.

    ca is a certificate authority key file. This worker will only trust incoming connections with
    keys that are trusted by the ca.

    We can defer implementing authentication for a bit, but for any open source release, anyone
    is going to worry about worker machines opening unencrypted ports and waiting for connections
    on a service that evals python code, so we should just build it in.

    Create a host mesh that is connected to the list of workers
    (it starts a single dimensional mesh of 'workers' and can be reshaped).

    This returns the host mesh immediately, and allows the logic for the hosts to
    connect to happen asynchronously. A separate future such as `await mesh.initialized` is
    used to decide if we have successfully connected to all hosts. Workers may
    be strings or monarch.actor.Future objects that resolve to strings.

    Each worker string accepts either of these formats:

    - A ZMQ-style channel URL such as ``tcp://worker-fqdn:4444``. This uses the
      legacy ``service`` proc identity.
    - A ProcAddr in ``<proc-id>@<location>`` form, such as
      ``service<2MuAHeDjLCEd>@tcp://worker-fqdn:4444``. This preserves the
      embedded service proc identity and full location.

    If a worker string uses the alias form ``dial_to@bind_to``,
    ``attach_to_workers`` treats it as a reference to an already-serving
    worker. Dialing uses ``dial_to``; ``bind_to`` remains a serve-side detail.
