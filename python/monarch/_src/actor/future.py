        Caveats:

        This method is designed to be used in places where event loops are not available. Besides that, you should
        avoid using this method if possible. Instead, use `as_asyncio()` (or `await`). This is because when Future.get() is called from
        within an active event loop, it blocks synchronously and does not yield control. That may degrade performance
        by preventing other tasks from running, and can potentially cause deadlocks if this future depends on them.

        A `timeout` never consumes the Future: on `TimeoutError` the underlying task keeps running, so a later `get()`/`await` still observes its result.

        examples:

        This is not recommended because `fut.get()` blocks the event loop and might lead to issues explained above.
        ```
        def inner_func(fut):
            result = fut.get()
            # ...

        async def out_func(fut):
            inner_func(fut)
        ```

        This is okay because everything is running synchronously.
        ```
        def inner_func(fut):
            result = fut.get()
            # ...
