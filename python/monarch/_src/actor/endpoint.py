    """Mark an ``Actor`` method as an endpoint callable from other actors.

    An endpoint defines part of an actor's public API. Once the actor is
    spawned onto a mesh, you invoke its endpoints through messaging adverbs
    (``call``, ``call_one``, ``choose``, ``stream``, ``broadcast``, and
    ``rref``) rather than calling the method directly. Each adverb controls how
    the message is delivered and how the response is returned. Endpoint methods
    may be synchronous or ``async``.

    Apply it bare or with options::

        class Counter(Actor):
            @endpoint
            def increment(self) -> int:
                ...

            @endpoint(explicit_response_port=True)
            async def stream_results(self, port: Port[int]) -> None:
                ...

    Args:
        method: The actor method to wrap. Supplied automatically when the
            decorator is applied without parentheses; leave it unset when
            passing options.
        propagate: Controls how the tensor engine infers output tensor shapes
            for ``rref`` without running the endpoint. Pass a callable that
            takes the endpoint's arguments (excluding ``self``) and returns
            tensors of the shapes the endpoint would produce, or one of the
            strings ``"cached"``, ``"inspect"``, or ``"mocked"``. Defaults to
            ``None``, which matters only for endpoints used with distributed
            tensors.
        explicit_response_port: When ``True``, the endpoint receives a ``Port``
            as its first argument (after ``self``) and is responsible for
            sending its result through that port instead of returning a value.
            This supports custom response protocols, such as sending several
            responses or deferring one. The method's return annotation should
            be ``None``.
        instrument: When ``True`` (the default), wrap each invocation in a
            tracing span named for the method.

    Returns:
        An ``EndpointProperty`` descriptor. Accessing it on a spawned actor
        yields an ``Endpoint`` exposing the messaging adverbs.
