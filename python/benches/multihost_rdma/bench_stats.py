"""
Measurements and reporting for the multi-host RDMA benchmark.

The benchmark's timings nest three deep. An *iteration* is one ``RDMAAction``
per initiator, submitted and awaited. A *run* is a set of freshly allocated
tensors and freshly registered RDMA buffers, exercised for several iterations. A
*phase* is a contiguous range of iterations within a run, pooled across runs, so
that a first iteration against fresh buffers is never averaged together with a
steady-state one.

Two clocks are in play and the difference matters. A :py:class:`Sample` is what
one initiator measured on its own clock. A *span* is what the driver measured on
its clock: from releasing every initiator to receiving the last reply.
Per-initiator throughput comes from the first, aggregate throughput from the
second.

Aggregate throughput is deliberately ``bytes_per_iteration / span``, not a sum
of per-initiator rates. A sum of rates cannot be checked against any wall clock
and silently assumes the initiators overlapped perfectly, so it flatters a
skewed run. Dividing by the span is measured rather than reconstructed, and it
is conservative: it includes release skew and the reply messages. That excess is
reported as ``overhead_ms`` so a reader knows exactly how pessimistic the
aggregate is, and ``submit_ms_std`` shows whether the initiators were balanced.

A cold iteration's time is dominated by one-time setup rather than by moving
bytes, so its throughput is not reported.

Every duration here is in milliseconds. Like :py:mod:`bench_topology`, this
module imports only the standard library.
