"""
Characterization oracle for deferred pickling.

Pins today's observable behavior: a mesh reference that is still *pending*
(spawned and sent in the same breath, before its background init finishes)
arrives at the other side as a usable reference, on both send paths: as an
endpoint argument (request path) and as an endpoint return value (reply path).
Today this rides the deferred-pickle subsystem (resolve-before-send plus a
re-pickle); a change to how pending references serialize must preserve these
outcomes. This is the safety net such a change checks against.

There is no hook to force the pending path; it relies on the
spawn-then-immediately-send race, which the synchronous pickle wins in practice
(the async mesh init cannot complete in the gap). Every test asserts the
end-to-end outcome. The argument tests also assert the reserve counter: a slot
is reserved only for a mesh still pending at pickle, so a nonzero count proves
the risky send-side pending path ran instead of resolving inline. That leans on
the race timescale (init is milliseconds, the synchronous gap microseconds); if
it ever flips the assertion goes red rather than passing hollow, and the
hardening then is a barrier holding init until after the pickle. The return
tests assert the pop counter, which proves the reply's reference reunited from
the out-of-band table (received and reconstructed), not that it was pending: a
resolved mesh also travels out-of-band, so pop cannot distinguish. Return-side
pending-ness happens in the spawner subprocess, invisible here, so it stays
outcome-only.
