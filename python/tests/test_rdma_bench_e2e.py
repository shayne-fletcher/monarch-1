"""
End-to-end tests for the multi-host RDMA benchmark, over real RDMA.

``test_rdma_bench_driver`` covers the driver's logic with its collaborators
substituted; these run the same code against real procs, real registrations and
a real fabric. ``--local-only`` is what makes that possible without a
scheduler: every host lands on this machine, so a whole invocation -- build the
graph, provision, measure every phase of both directions, verify, write the CSV
-- runs here. The lane pairing supplies the proc-to-proc edges a single host
would otherwise lack.

``tmp_path`` is pytest's per-test temporary directory fixture, which is where
each case puts its CSV.

What these are really for is the CSV. Every number the benchmark reports passes
through it, and a row whose phase, sample counts, or empty throughput cells are
wrong is a number somebody would go on to quote.
