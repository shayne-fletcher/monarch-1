"""Interpreter-exit actor-loop regression test.

Two arms, gated separately:

``unmitigated``
    the `SIGABRT` oracle. CPython 3.13 changed daemon-thread finalization from
    forced exit to a hang (gh-87135), so this arm only runs below 3.13.

``fixed``
    "zero actor-loop threads survive shutdown". Version-independent, and most
    informative on 3.14 where the unfixed symptom would be a hang rather than
    an abort. Runs on every supported version.
