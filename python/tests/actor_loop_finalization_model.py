"""Constructed reproduction of the interpreter-exit actor-loop abort.

Run by ``test_actor_loop_finalization``. Two arms:

``unmitigated``
    suppress the loop marker so the production reaper cannot see the loops,
    then hold one of them inside a PyO3 call across interpreter finalization.
    CPython <= 3.12 force-exits that daemon thread with ``pthread_exit``; the
    forced unwind crosses PyO3's ``catch_unwind`` and glibc aborts.

``fixed``
    leave the marker in place and let the reaper run. Version-independent.

Neither arm uses ``Thread.join()`` or ``Thread.is_alive()``: on CPython 3.14
``is_alive()`` can enter an unbounded OS-thread join once ``thread_is_exiting``
is set, and this module runs on 3.14. Thread liveness is observed by membership
in ``threading.enumerate()`` and waited for by bounded polling.
