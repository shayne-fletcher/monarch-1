"""Blocking Monarch entry points must reject unsafe Tokio re-entry.

Bootstrapping a client ends in ``block_on()``, which panics on a Tokio runtime
worker. The guard rejects fresh bootstrap from every Tokio runtime context,
including its blocking pool, while still allowing an already-initialized client
to be reused. Worker-loop blocking wrappers likewise reject before eager native
startup, while the non-blocking start remains allowed.
