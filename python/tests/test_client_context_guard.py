"""Fresh root-client bootstrap must not be attempted from inside Tokio.

Bootstrapping a client ends in ``block_on()``, which panics on a Tokio runtime
worker. The guard rejects fresh bootstrap from every Tokio runtime context,
including its blocking pool, while still allowing an already-initialized client
to be reused.
