"""Worker-loop eager-start, context rejection, errors, and signal behavior.

The native start binding returns a ``Handle`` immediately. Host failures are
published through that Handle, while dropping it does not cancel a successfully
started worker. A SIGTERM handler installed after startup must remain active
while that worker is serving.

Each case runs in a child process under a deadline because a successful forever
worker owns its process lifetime.
