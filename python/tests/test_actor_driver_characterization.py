"""
Characterization oracle for the actor endpoint driver.

Pins the load-bearing runtime fact the pytokio-removal Stage 3 audit rests on:
an ``@endpoint`` body runs on a real asyncio event loop (driven by the Rust
dispatcher via ``into_future_with_locals``), NOT on a bare tokio worker thread.
Concretely, inside an endpoint:

  - ``asyncio.get_running_loop()`` succeeds (a loop is running); and
  - a bare ``await PythonTask.sleep(0)`` raises (pytokio refuses to await a raw
    ``PythonTask`` while an asyncio loop is active); and
  - awaiting a monarch ``Future`` takes the ``_Handle`` (asyncio) path, never
    ``_Tokio`` -- the Step-3.0 ``_Tokio``-production oracle records zero entries
    for the endpoint body.

This is why the reverted "A1" reroute (replacing ``await Future(...)`` in the
reply path with a bare ``await PythonTask``) was wrong: under the loop the bare
await raises. If a future change switches the dispatcher to drive endpoints on
the tokio runtime (``PythonTask.from_coroutine``), these assertions flip -- which
is the exact signal that such reroutes become valid. Pinned for both dispatch
modes (queue and direct).
