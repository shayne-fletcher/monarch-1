"""Characterization oracle for the public ``monarch`` ``Future`` state machine.

Pins the behavior of ``monarch._src.actor.future.Future`` -- its internal
states and the transitions between them, ``as_asyncio()`` and the ``__await__``
shim over it, rejection of Tokio-thread awaits, the ``get()``-inside-a-loop
warning, and the ``_take_inner()`` accessor with its ``_Taken`` terminal state
-- so that any change to that behavior is caught here and made explicit.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Future/Handle contract matrix
#
# Three proof layers, kept structurally apart on purpose:
#
#   * incumbent Future oracle -- what the public facade does today;
#   * direct Handle oracle    -- what the underlying Handle does, observed
#                                through a real Rust-produced Handle rather
#                                than through the facade;
#   * Handle-backed facade    -- how a Future built directly on a Handle
#                                behaves. Not executable yet: Future has no
#                                Handle-backed constructor.
#
# The third layer is a seam, not a promise. Every target assertion lives in an
# ``_assert_*`` helper that takes a *factory*, never a hard-coded constructor,
# and each row is driven by one of four registries below. Adding a
# Handle-backed Future factory to a registry runs that row's assertions against
# the facade with no edit to the assertion body.
#
# Assertions that pin an incumbent divergence are deliberately NOT
# factory-driven: they describe behavior that is going away, and there is
# nothing to activate.
#
# Registry per row (every one of the 15 has a seam):
#
#   PRESERVED_BY_BOTH  -- target already satisfied by both representations
#     fm.repeated_observation, fm.exception_identity, fm.off_loop_as_asyncio
#   TARGET_ONLY        -- ready observable; only the Handle satisfies it today
#     fm.ready_get_on_loop_warns, fm.ready_get_on_tokio_refuses,
#     fm.invalid_timeout_on_ready, fm.ready_as_asyncio_settlement,
#     fm.terminal_baseexception_reobservable, fm.off_loop_await, fm.tokio_await
#   GATED_TARGETS      -- (control, observable) pairs, producer held mid-flight
#     fm.timeout_then_success, fm.cancelled_observer
#   FACADE_FACTORIES   -- facade-only surfaces, no Handle primitive
#     fm.get_tracing_event, fm.result_alias, fm.exception_accessor
#
# Incumbent-divergence companions (not factory-driven, no activation):
#   fm.ready_get_on_tokio_refuses, fm.invalid_timeout_on_ready,
#   fm.ready_as_asyncio_settlement, fm.terminal_baseexception_reobservable
#
# fm.cancelled_observer also has an unparametrized current-side test, but it is
# a *preserve* row: both representations behave identically, so that test is a
# second oracle for the same behavior, not a divergence.
#
# The permanent Handle-side oracle for fm.tokio_await lives in handle.rs, so
# that contract does not depend on a PythonTask-driven helper.
