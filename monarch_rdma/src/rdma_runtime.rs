//! A shared, dedicated Tokio runtime for RDMA actors and data-plane tasks.
//!
//! RDMA buffer registration scans `torch.cuda` segments under the GIL
//! (`backend::ibverbs::mlx_domain` -> `pytorch_cuda_segments`), so the RDMA actor
//! loops run here rather than on the shared control-plane runtime.
//!
//! # Invariants (RR-*)
//!
//! - **RR-1 (process-singleton):** one shared rdma runtime exists per process
//!   (built once, lazily), serving all RDMA actors rather than one per actor.
//!   Sharing is safe because RDMA keeps no per-thread state that would pin an
//!   actor or queue-pair task to a worker. Queue-pair tasks await tokio channels,
//!   whose cooperative scheduling prevents a ready task from monopolizing a
//!   runtime worker.
//! - **RR-2 (shared-runtime-routing):** the RDMA actors (`RdmaManagerActor`,
//!   `IbvManagerActor`, `QueuePairActor`) route `spawn_server_task` through
//!   [`spawn_on_rdma_runtime`], not ad hoc `tokio::spawn`.
//! - **RR-3 (rdma-is-data-plane):** [`spawn_on_rdma_runtime`] runs its future on
//!   a `DataPlane("rdma")` thread.
//! - **RR-4 (registration-off-control-plane):** consequently, the GIL taken
//!   during buffer registration lands on a `DataPlane("rdma")` thread, never the
//!   shared control-plane runtime (where a blocked GIL-holder would stall actor
//!   dispatch, supervision, and networking).
//! - **RR-5 (cross-runtime-joinhandle):** the `JoinHandle` from
//!   [`spawn_on_rdma_runtime`] is awaitable from the caller's runtime, so it is
//!   returned directly rather than bridged through a relay task.
