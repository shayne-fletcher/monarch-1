//! # RDMA Buffer
//!
//! This module provides an abstraction for Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) buffers.
//! The `RdmaBuffer` struct represents a handle or view into memory that can be accessed
//! remotely via RDMA operations.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - `RdmaBuffer` is a lightweight handle to memory regions registered with RDMA
//! - Each buffer is associated with an `RdmaManagerActor` that handles the underlying RDMA operations
//! - The architecture follows a client-server model where actors can access each other's memory
//! - Connection management is handled automatically between actors when operations are performed
//! - Memory regions are registered with the RDMA subsystem for zero-copy access
//!
//! ## Usage Pattern
//!
//! - An actor creates an `RdmaBuffer` for its local memory and can share this handle with other actors
//! - Creating an `RdmaBuffer` requires an existing `RdmaManagerActor` on the same Proc. Multiple `RdmaBuffer` instances
//!   can be associated with the same `RdmaManagerActor`
//! - `RdmaBuffer` operations can only be performed in the context of actors, as they require access to a mailbox
//!   for communication
//! - Actors can interact with an `RdmaBuffer` using their own mailbox to send messages to the buffer's
//!   associated `RdmaManagerActor`
//!
//! ## Key Operations
//!
//! - Reading data from the buffer into a local destination (`read_into`)
//! - Writing data from a local source into the buffer (`write_from`)
//! - Releasing resources when they're no longer needed (`release`)
//! - Establishing connections between actors (`maybe_connect`, called automatically)
//!
//! RDMA operations can be performed synchronously (waiting for completion) or
//! asynchronously by setting the `wait_for_completion` parameter to `true` or `false` respectively.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! RdmaBuffer exposes raw one-sided RDMA operations (reads, writes) that are inherently asynchronous
/// and unsynchronized. It **does not enforce locking or memory consistency guarantees** between
/// local and remote peers. The caller is responsible for ensuring proper synchronization to avoid
/// data races, stale reads, or inconsistent state.
///
/// This design choice is intentional: adding locking at this layer would impose assumptions and
/// constraints that may not align with higher-level usage patterns. Users who require safety
/// guarantees should implement coordination mechanisms at a higher abstraction layer.
