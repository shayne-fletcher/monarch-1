//! A device's pool of completion queues, and the leases queue pairs hold on
//! them.
//!
//! One completion queue serves several queue pairs, so that one poller can reap
//! for all of them. How many share a completion queue is fixed by
//! [`crate::config::RDMA_QPS_PER_CQ`], and each completion queue is sized to
//! hold every sharer's work requests at once:
//!
//! ```text
//! cq_entries = queue_pairs_per_cq * max_send_wr
//! ```
//!
//! That is what lets completions be reaped without any runtime credit
//! accounting: a queue pair caps its own outstanding work requests at
//! `max_send_wr`, so it can never leave more than `max_send_wr` completion-queue
//! entries unreaped, and the completion queue is sized for exactly that much per
//! queue pair leasing it. Overflow -- which puts a completion queue into
//! an unrecoverable error state -- is therefore structurally impossible rather
//! than merely unlikely.
//!
//! One assumption holds that reasoning up, and breaking it means this sizing has
//! to be revisited: nothing posts receive work requests on these queue pairs. A
//! receive work request yields an entry too, but is bounded by `max_recv_wr`
//! rather than `max_send_wr`, so it would consume capacity this sizing does not
//! account for.
