"""
Distributed Telemetry with Real Tracing Data.

This example demonstrates querying real tracing data collected from actors.
Unlike the hello_world example which uses fake demo data, this example:

1. Starts telemetry with use_fake_data=False
2. Spawns actors that do work (generating real tracing events)
3. Queries the spans, span_events, events, and actors tables

The RecordBatchSink automatically captures tracing events and stores them
in queryable Arrow tables. Actor creation events are captured separately
via the ActorEventSink.

Usage:
    python distributed_telemetry_real_data.py
