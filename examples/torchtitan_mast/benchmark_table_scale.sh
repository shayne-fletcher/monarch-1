# Host-count scaling sweep for the torchtitan_mast data plane, on CPU-only MAST
# hosts. This is the scale-out companion to benchmark_table.sh: it drops the two
# GPU training rows (CPU hosts have no GPUs) and instead runs the host-count-
# dependent rows once per host count, so you can read how the numbers change as
# the allocation grows. Rows measured per host count:
#   apply_wall_incl_alloc  apply wall clock (includes MAST queue/alloc)
#   apply_mount_open       reproducible "mounts opened in Ns" from the sidecar
#   exec_all_echo_wall     `monarch exec --all -- echo hello`  (1 proc/host)
#   exec_one_hostname_wall `monarch exec --one -- hostname`
#   import_torch_cold_wall cold `import torch` on every worker (on-demand .so fan-out)
#   import_torch_warm_wall warm `import torch` (blocks already resident)
#   import_torch_*_perworker best-effort slowest-worker import secs (needs log forwarding)
#   checksum_wall          every worker streams+sha256s the mounted files (correctness read)
#   checksum_match         OK iff every host's bytes match the client source hash (else MISMATCH; TIMEOUT if the read was too slow to finish)
#   checksum_hosts_ok      hosts verified byte-identical (= N when checksum_match=OK; exec rc guarantees it)
#   checksum_nfiles        number of files verified per host
#   reapply_wall           no-change re-apply (mount refresh + exec/connect floor)
#   reapply_mount_open     refresh time, if the sidecar prints it
#   kill_wall              teardown
#
# Each host count is an independent `apply -> measure -> kill` cycle against a
# fresh MAST allocation of that many WHOLE T1 CPU hosts (one worker per host),
# selected via TITAN_HOST_TYPE=cpu (see simple_mast_job/build_bootstrap.py).
# `import torch` still exercises the mount's big-.so fan-out on CPU hosts even
# though CUDA never initializes.
#
# A host count of 0 is special: it runs the import-torch and checksum probes
# LOCALLY on the client (no MAST allocation, no remotemount, no network), against
# the workspace venv on local disk. This is the true performance floor -- the same
# work with zero delivery overhead -- emitted as hosts=0 rows so it sits beside the
# remote counts as a reference. Only import_torch_warm_wall (the compute floor;
# there is no local cold -- see run_local) and checksum_* are meaningful locally;
# apply/exec/mount_open/reapply/kill are remote-only and are omitted for hosts=0.
#
# Correctness at scale: the checksum step makes EVERY worker read every byte of
# the big mounted files and verify each against the client-side (source-of-truth)
# sha256. `monarch exec --all` returns nonzero iff any host's bytes diverged, so
# a green `checksum_match=OK` row means the on-demand mount delivered
# byte-identical content to all N hosts -- i.e. it scales accurately, not just
# fast. Any mismatch prints the offending file/host to stderr.
#
# Output: benchmark_table_scale.csv (long form: hosts,metric,value,unit), written
# incrementally so a partial/aborted sweep keeps its rows. On apply timeout or a
# job that never comes up, a `status,FAIL` row is recorded, the job is killed,
# and the sweep continues to the next size.
#
# By default this REBUILDS monarch from the CURRENT source first (setup_env.sh
# --force), like benchmark_table.sh, so the numbers reflect what you're editing
# rather than a stale cached wheel. Set SCALE_REBUILD=0 to reuse the existing
# build (for re-running / extending a sweep against one wheel). Either way the
# wheel's build time is printed at the start so a stale wheel is never silent.
#
# Tunables (env):
#   SCALE_HOSTS          host counts to sweep (default "1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024");
#                        include 0 to also measure the local no-MAST/no-remotemount floor
#   SCALE_REBUILD        1=rebuild monarch from source before sweeping (default), 0=reuse existing wheel
#   SCALE_APPLY_TIMEOUT  per-apply timeout incl. MAST queue wait, seconds (default 1800)
#   SCALE_EXEC_TIMEOUT   per-exec/kill timeout, seconds (default 600)
#   SCALE_OUT            output CSV (default ./benchmark_table_scale.csv)
#   SCALE_APPEND         1=append to an existing CSV instead of overwriting (extend a sweep)
#   SCALE_CKSUM          1=run the per-cycle checksum correctness check (default), 0=skip
#   SCALE_CKSUM_MIN_MB   min file size (MiB) in the checksum set (default 100; the big .so's)
#   TITAN_CPU_CPUS       cores per CPU worker host (default 15)
#   TITAN_CPU_RAM_MB     RAM per CPU worker host, MB (default 54272)
#   TITAN_LOCALITY_REGIONS  region pin (default eag); set "none" to let MAST place
#                           workers in any region -- often needed past ~64 hosts.
#   MONARCH              monarch client binary (default ~/monarch_bench_envs/client/bin/monarch)
