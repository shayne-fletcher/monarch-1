# Running Monarch on Kubernetes

This directory contains examples for running Monarch on Kubernetes. Monarch provides native Kubernetes integration via MonarchMesh CRD and Operator.
It is also vendor-independent and lets users decide how they want to schedule and orchestrate Monarch hosts.

## Provision Monarch Hosts from Python (Recommended)

The simplest way to run Monarch on Kubernetes: create MonarchMesh CRDs
directly from Python. No YAML manifests for worker pods are needed.

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with [Monarch CRD and operator](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch-kubernetes/) installed
- `kubectl` configured to access the cluster
- The `monarch-tests` namespace created:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace monarch-tests
  ```
- (Optional) [Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/) installed for gang scheduling, and the `"user-queue"` `LocalQueue` created by applying the quota and queue configuration:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f manifests/kueue_quota.yaml
  ```

### Deploy the Controller

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/hello_provision.yaml
```

This creates a controller pod with RBAC permissions to create MonarchMesh CRDs and watch pods.

### Running the Example

```bash
# Copy the script to the controller
kubectl cp hello_kubernetes_job.py monarch-tests/hello-controller:/tmp/hello_kubernetes_job.py

# Run with --provision to create MonarchMesh CRDs from Python
kubectl exec -it hello-controller -n monarch-tests -- python /tmp/hello_kubernetes_job.py --provision

# Optionally exercise a small RDMABuffer transfer over TCP fallback
kubectl exec -it hello-controller -n monarch-tests -- python /tmp/hello_kubernetes_job.py --provision --rdma-smoke

# (Optional) Run with Kueue for gang scheduling (mesh level)
kubectl exec -it hello-controller -n monarch-tests -- python /tmp/hello_kubernetes_job.py --provision --kueue user-queue
```

The `--provision` flag tells `KubernetesJob` to create the MonarchMesh CRDs via the K8s API.
When the script finishes, it cleans up by deleting the CRDs.

### Expected Output

```
From MonarchMesh mesh1: hello from mesh1-0
From MonarchMesh mesh2: hello from mesh2-0
```

### Cleanup
```bash
kubectl delete -f manifests/hello_provision.yaml
kubectl delete -f manifests/kueue_quota.yaml  # If used
```

## Provision Monarch Hosts with MonarchMesh YAML Manifests

### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with [Monarch CRD and operator](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch-kubernetes/) installed
- `kubectl` configured to access the cluster
- The `monarch-tests` namespace created:
  ```bash
  kubectl create namespace monarch-tests
  ```
- (Optional) [Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/) installed for gang scheduling, and the `"user-queue"` `LocalQueue` created by applying the quota and queue configuration:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f manifests/kueue_quota.yaml
  ```

### Deploy the MonarchMesh and Controller

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/hello_mesh.yaml
```

### Verify Pods are Running

```bash
# Check worker pods for mesh1
kubectl get pods -n monarch-tests -l app.kubernetes.io/name=monarch-worker,monarch.pytorch.org/mesh-name=mesh1

# Check worker pods for mesh2
kubectl get pods -n monarch-tests -l app.kubernetes.io/name=monarch-worker,monarch.pytorch.org/mesh-name=mesh2

# Check controller pod
kubectl get pods -n monarch-tests hello-controller
```

Wait for all pods to show `Running` status.

### Running the Example In-Cluster

Copy and execute the script from the controller pod:

```bash
# Copy the script to the controller
kubectl cp hello_kubernetes_job.py monarch-tests/hello-controller:/tmp/hello_kubernetes_job.py

# Get a shell into the controller
kubectl exec -it hello-controller -n monarch-tests -- /bin/bash

# Inside the controller, run the example
python /tmp/hello_kubernetes_job.py

# (Optional) Run with Kueue for gang scheduling
python /tmp/hello_kubernetes_job.py --kueue user-queue
```

Or run directly without shell:
```bash
kubectl exec -it hello-controller -n monarch-tests -- python /tmp/hello_kubernetes_job.py
```

### Expected Output

```
From MonarchMesh mesh1: hello from mesh1-worker-0
From MonarchMesh mesh2: hello from mesh2-worker-0
```

### Cleanup
```bash
kubectl delete -f manifests/hello_mesh.yaml
kubectl delete -f manifests/kueue_quota.yaml  # If used
```

## Provision Monarch Hosts with Third-Party Scheduler

### Volcano Scheduler

#### Prerequisites

- A Kubernetes cluster with [Volcano scheduler](https://volcano.sh/en/docs/installation/) installed
- `kubectl` configured to access the cluster
- The `monarch-tests` namespace created

#### Provisioning Monarch Hosts with Volcano Scheduler

The `volcano_workers.yaml` manifest launches Monarch worker pods using Volcano's gang scheduling. This ensures all pods in a mesh are scheduled together or not at all.

Volcano automatically adds labels to pods:
- `volcano.sh/job-name` - the Volcano Job name (used for pod discovery)
- `volcano.sh/task-index` - ordinal index (0, 1, 2, ...) for ordering workers

#### Deploy the workers

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/volcano_workers.yaml
```

#### Verify pods are running

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monarch-tests -l volcano.sh/job-name=mesh1
kubectl get pods -n monarch-tests -l volcano.sh/job-name=mesh2
```

#### Running the Example

Once the workers are running, execute the example script from a pod within the cluster:

```bash
python hello_kubernetes_job.py --volcano
```

The `--volcano` flag configures `KubernetesJob` to use Volcano's labels:
- `volcano.sh/job-name=<mesh-name>` for pod discovery
- `volcano.sh/task-index` for pod ordering

#### Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete -f manifests/volcano_workers.yaml
```

## Out-of-Cluster Execution

You can also run the same examples shown here from outside the cluster! The client runs locally
and sends messages to the mesh inside the cluster. This relies on port-forwarding
the monarch port on a single host in your cluster. The monarch port doubles as the
attach endpoint, so no extra configuration is needed on the worker side.
The easiest way is with `kubectl port-forward`:
```
kubectl port-forward -n monarch-tests pod/mesh1-0 26600:26600
```
This will forward localhost port 26600 to the monarch port on the pod.
You can use any local port; it doesn't need to match the port on the pod.

```bash
uv run --no-build-isolation hello_kubernetes_job.py --out-of-cluster --attach-to tcp://localhost:26600
```

Or, for provisioning mode, use:
```bash
uv run --no-build-isolation hello_kubernetes_job.py --out-of-cluster --provision
```

To include a small `RDMABuffer` transfer between the two meshes over TCP fallback, add `--rdma-smoke`.

The `--out-of-cluster` flag tells `KubernetesJob` to attach the client's mailbox
to the host. The `--attach-to` flag tells it which host to attach to. In provisioning
mode, we automatically expose the port on the pods, do a port-forward for you,
and attach to that pod.

Some caveats with this approach:
* Your version of monarch locally and on the cluster must match exactly. If they
  don't you may get timeouts or errors on the server decoding messages that may have
  skew between the two versions. If you make local changes to monarch, you must
  send them out in a new container for the pods
* Your local python code may not exist on the remote machines. When we send requests
  to PythonActor, we use `cloudpickle`, which may end up trying to import your
  modules on the mesh. For this reason, it's also best to ensure your container
  contains the same versions of all your local modules and source code.
* Your local client and remote mesh may have different hardware, for example on
  the cluster you may have access to RDMA and on the client you do not. Same goes
  for other hardware like GPUs and CPUs. Be careful not to run things on the client
  that may assume certain hardware. Even functions on torch.Tensor like
  `tensor.to("cuda:0")` will fail if your client doesn't have that device.

## Building a Docker Image

If you make local changes to Monarch, publish a new container image so the pods
run your build. See
[Building a Docker Image from Source](../../../README.md#building-a-docker-image-from-source)
in the top-level README. In `--provision` mode, pass `--image` to select which
image the provisioned hosts use.
