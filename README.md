# Monarch 🦋

**Monarch** is a distributed execution engine for PyTorch. Our overall goal is
to deliver the high-quality user experience that people get from single-GPU
PyTorch, but at cluster scale.

> ⚠️ **Early Development Warning** Monarch is currently in an experimental
> stage. You should expect bugs, incomplete features, and APIs that may change
> in future versions. The project welcomes bugfixes, but to make sure things are
> well coordinated you should discuss any significant change before starting the
> work. It's recommended that you signal your intention to contribute in the
> issue tracker, either by filing a new issue or by claiming an existing one.

Note: Monarch is currently only supported on Linux systems
