# Meshes
# ------
# All computation is done on a 'mesh' of devices.
# Here we create a mesh composed of the machine running the notebook:

mesh = this_host().spawn_procs({"gpu": 8})
print(mesh.to_table())

# %%
# Without a mesh active, torch runs locally.

torch.rand(3, 4)

# %%
# Once active, torch runs on every device in the mesh.

with mesh.activate():
    t = torch.rand(3, 4, device="cuda")

t

# %%
# Inspect moves rank0's copy of t to the notebook for debugging.

monarch.inspect(t)

monarch.show(t)

# %%
# Providing coordinates lets us inspect other ranks copies.

monarch.show(t, gpu=1)

# %%
# Tensor Commands
# ---------------
#
# Any command done on the controller, such as multiplying these tensors,
# performs that action to all of the tensors in the collection.

with mesh.activate():
    obj = t @ t.T
    monarch.show(obj)

# %%
# If a command fails, the workers stay alive and can execute future
# commands:

        monarch.show(v)

# %%
# Since monarch recovers from errors, you can search for
# what works:

N = 1
while True:

        with mesh.activate():

    except Exception:
        print(f"max is 2**{N} elements")
        break

# %%
# Collectives
# -----------
# Each machine has its own copy of the tensor, similar to torch.distributed.
#
# To compute across tensors in the mesh, we use special communication operators, analogous to collectives.

# Remote GPUs
# ---------
#
# We can also connect to remote GPUs reserved from some scheduler

# NYI: schedule public API based on config, just fake it locally

# ----------

# Pipelining is accomplished by slicing the mesh, and copying tensors from
# one mesh to another.

# DDP Example
# -----------
#
# The next sections will use an example of writing DDP to illustrate a
# typical way to develop code in monarch.
#
# Let's interleave the backward pass with the gradient reductions and
# parameter updates.
#
# We use monarch.grad_generator to incrementally run the backward pass.
# It returns an iterator that computes the grad parameters one at a time.

# Simulation of DDP

# We can use a simulator to check for expected behavior of code before running it
# for real.
#
# It is another kind of mesh, which simulates rather than computes results for real.

# Overlapping Comms/Compute

# To use a tensor from one stream on another we borrow it. The borrow API ensures determinstic memory usage,
# and eliminates the race conditions in the torch.cuda.stream API.
