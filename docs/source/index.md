# Monarch 🦋

**Monarch** is a distributed programming framework for PyTorch based on scalable
actor messaging. It provides:

1. Remote actors with scalable messaging: Actors are grouped into collections called meshes and messages can be broadcast to all members.
2. Fault tolerance through supervision trees: Actors and processes form a tree and failures propagate up the tree, providing good default error behavior and enabling fine-grained fault recovery.
3. Point-to-point RDMA transfers: cheap registration of any GPU or CPU memory in a process, with the one-sided transfers based on libibverbs
4. Distributed tensors: actors can work with tensor objects sharded across processes

Monarch code imperatively describes how to create processes and actors using a simple python API:

```python
from monarch.actor import Actor, endpoint, this_host

# spawn 8 trainer processes one for each gpu
training_procs = this_host().spawn_procs({"gpus": 8})


# define the actor to run on each process
class Trainer(Actor):
    @endpoint
    def train(self, step: int): ...


# create the trainers
trainers = training_procs.spawn("trainers", Trainer)

# tell all the trainers to take a step
fut = trainers.train.call(step=0)

# wait for all trainers to complete
fut.get()
```

Note: Monarch runs on Linux and macOS.
  - The CPU-only tensor engine works on macOS and on Linux hosts without a GPU
  - GPU features require Linux with a supported GPU toolchain

## Getting Started

Here are some suggested steps to get started with Monarch:

1. **Installation**: Check out the [Install guide](installation) for getting monarch installed.
2. **Getting Started**: The [getting started](./generated/examples/getting_started) provides an introduction to Monarch's core API
3. **Explore Examples**: Review the [Examples](./generated/examples/index) to see Monarch in action
4. **Cookbook**: Browse the [Cookbook](cookbook) for short, task-oriented recipes.
5. **Dive Deeper**: Explore the API Documentation for more detailed information:
    - [Python API](api/index)
    - [Rust API](rust-api)
6. **Deep Understanding of Actors**: Gain comprehensive knowledge of [Actors](actors), the foundational building blocks of Monarch.
7. **Monitoring Tools**: Inspect running meshes with the [Admin TUI](admin-tui) (terminal) or the [Monarch Dashboard](monarch-dashboard) (web GUI).
