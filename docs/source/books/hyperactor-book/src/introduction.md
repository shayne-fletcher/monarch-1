# Hyperactor

This book describes the design and implementation of the hyperactor runtime.

The goal is to provide a clear, structured explanation of how actors communicate safely and efficiently across distributed systems using hyperactor’s abstractions.

We hope this becomes the book we wish we had when we started working with Monarch. Work in progress.
