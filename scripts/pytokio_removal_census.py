"""Checked inventory of the remaining ``pytokio`` surface.

Temporary migration tooling for the Stage 6 pytokio removal. It reconciles the
legacy sites discovered in Monarch source with the reviewed rows in
``pytokio_removal_census.toml``, so that no later diff can add, remove, or
reclassify a pytokio boundary without an explicit manifest edit.

Two modes:

``--check``
    Fail on an unknown hit, a stale row, a duplicate or missing identifier, a
    total mismatch, a missing required field, an import member-set change, an
    undeclared or unowned transition, or a malformed migration revision. This
    is the only landing gate.

``--summary``
    Print active and tombstoned entry counts by category, file, and owning
    transition.

Run from the fbsource repository root. Stdlib only, read-only. Deleted in
Stage 6.8 once the independent searches are zero.

For operational usage -- what the sections mean, what each behavior field
records, how states and transitions work, and the drift and update workflow --
read the guide at the top of ``pytokio_removal_census.toml``. That guide is the
reference for maintaining the data; this docstring is the reference for
maintaining the code. The two are deliberately not duplicates.

Implementation guide
====================

Pipeline. ``check`` and ``summarize`` both drive the same front half:

    load manifest
      -> enumerate bounded sources        (source_files)
      -> language-specific discovery      (scan_rust, scan_python, scan_stub,
                                           scan_text)
      -> normalize and collapse hits      (collapse, applied by discover)
      -> validate schema and transitions  (validate_rows, validate_transitions,
                                           validate_matrix)
      -> reconcile rows against hits      (reconcile)
      -> validate totals                  (validate_totals)
      -> report                           (error list, or summarize)

``discover`` owns the first three steps and returns normalized hits.
Everything after it is pure comparison between those hits and the manifest.

The Hit model. A ``Hit`` is one discovered occurrence: path, symbol, operation,
line, and optionally the imported ``members`` set or a regex ``capture``.
Identity is ``(path, symbol, operation)`` -- the ``locator`` -- and the line is
carried for diagnostics only. Keeping the line out of identity is what lets an
unrelated edit move code without invalidating rows.

Rust lexical views. Rust has no stdlib parser here, so ``lex_rust`` does the
one job a regex cannot: it walks the whole file once and returns two views of
it, both the same length and with the same newline positions as the source, so
an offset in either maps back to a line.

    scannable   comments blanked, string and char literals kept. This is what
                patterns match against, so prose in a ``//``, ``///`` or
                ``/* */`` comment is never inventoried as a call site, while a
                symbol named inside a string literal -- a config key, say --
                still is.
    structural  comments *and* literal contents blanked. This is what block
                depth is counted from, so a brace inside a string or a ``'{'``
                char cannot close a block early.

Using one view for both jobs is what produced the two classes of bug this
replaced: matching raw lines inventoried documentation, and counting braces
from a naively comment-stripped line let a ``//`` inside a string discard the
line's closing brace. Whole-file rather than per-line because block comments
nest, and both block comments and raw strings carry state across newlines.

Rust ownership parsing. ``rust_symbols`` consumes the structural view and
returns the qualified enclosing symbol for every line, so a hit can be
attributed without a second pass. It tracks ``impl`` and ``trait`` blocks on a
stack keyed by brace depth and resolves each impl header through
``parse_impl_header``, which skips balanced generics and splits on the ``for``
at depth zero. The result is ``Type::method``, ``<Type as Trait>::method``, or
``Trait::method`` for a trait default body -- which is what distinguishes two
methods sharing a bare name, and what keeps a default method's identity stable
only while it stays in its trait.

``unsafe impl`` and ``default impl`` are recognized as impl headers. They are
common, and matching only a bare ``impl`` would attribute their methods as free
functions.

Headers that span lines are buffered until their opening brace. This parsing
fails closed on purpose: an unbalanced generic or a header that never
terminates raises ``CensusError`` rather than guessing, because a wrong
qualifier would silently attribute a block's methods to another type and the
manifest would then encode that mistake.

``scan_rust`` matches over the whole scannable view rather than line by line,
under ``re.MULTILINE`` so a leading ``^`` still anchors per line. Whole-file
matching is what lets a pattern reach a macro's arguments on the lines below
the line that opens it, and capture from them. Each match is attributed to the
symbol owning the line where it starts.

Python identity. Calls and imports are found through ``ast`` rather than line
matching, so a construct split across lines is found and a match inside a
string or comment is not. Relative imports are resolved against the file's
repository path before comparison, and matched by dotted suffix, because the
resolved name carries the directories above the Python package root that the
configured literal does not. Ignoring ``node.level`` would make every relative
pytokio import invisible. A call site's symbol is its enclosing scope plus the
unparsed call target and first argument, ``scope[target(arg)]``. Both halves
matter: one function can hold two distinct roots, and one function can take the
inner task of several different receivers. ``ast.unparse`` is used so that
subscripts and chained calls survive; a lossy renderer would merge sites that
are genuinely distinct.

Narrower textual scanners. Stubs and documents have no call graph to walk.
``scan_stub`` matches declarations, and ``scan_text`` records at most one hit
per document, because a document is inventoried as "this file mentions the
legacy surface", not once per mention. Both are deliberately weaker than the
AST path and are used only where an AST would not apply.

Normalization. Some operations are reference-shaped rather than site-shaped.
``collapse`` reduces those to one hit per surface: operations listed in
``symbol_capture_operations`` collapse per file and captured symbol, so a
helper is inventoried as "which files use it" and a second reference in the
same file does not create a second row; operations listed in
``per_file_operations`` collapse to one hit per file. Everything else passes
through untouched. ``collapse`` is defined among the scanners but runs last,
from ``discover``.

Every alternative of a ``symbol_capture_operations`` pattern must carry a
capture group, and ``collapse`` raises when a matched hit has none. Falling
back to the enclosing symbol -- the obvious-looking default -- would key two
distinct sites in one scope to the same locator and silently merge them, which
is a false negative in the central bijection.

Scope. ``source_files`` enumerates the Monarch roots only. Downstream callers
of the public pytokio API are a stated exclusion, swept with code search rather
than content-scanned here; the manifest guide records why and what it costs.

Four kinds of checking, which are easy to confuse:

    schema validation      (validate_rows, validate_matrix) -- is each row
                           well formed, are its enum values declared, is its
                           identity unique?
    transition validation  (validate_transitions) -- does the owning transition
                           declare this site, does it permit the state, and is
                           the provenance revision well formed and consistent
                           with the state?
    reconciliation         (reconcile) -- does the source agree with the
                           manifest, in both directions?
    totals                 (validate_totals) -- does the expected aggregate
                           count agree, and does every configured operation
                           have a total? Reconciliation is what catches a
                           net-zero swap, reporting the missing locator and
                           the unknown one. Totals are an independent
                           aggregate and parity check alongside it, not a
                           backstop for that case.

``check`` withholds rows that failed the required-field gate from the
validators that index those fields. Those rows are already reported; passing
them on would raise ``KeyError`` and replace the accumulated error list with a
traceback.

Tombstones participate in the first two and not the third. A migrated or
removed_upstream row is still schema- and transition-validated, and still holds
its locator against reuse, but ``reconcile`` skips it, because by definition its
source hit is gone. That is what makes a completed migration auditable without
making it look like drift.

Adding a new tracked operation. Five edits, all in one diff:

    1. a pattern under the appropriate ``[config.patterns.*]`` table in the
       manifest, plus ``operation_paths`` scoping if the symbol has an
       unrelated homonym elsewhere in the tree;
    2. an expected count in ``[totals]``, and a ``[total_units]`` entry if it
       is counted by file rather than by hit;
    3. one ``[[site]]`` row per discovered hit, with a category drawn from
       ``schema.categories``;
    4. ownership: each new row listed in the ``owns`` array of the transition
       that removes it; and
    5. a counterexample fixture in ``test_pytokio_removal_census.py`` proving
       the new operation fails when it should -- an unexpected hit, a missing
       hit, or a mis-scoped homonym.

Pattern literals stay in the manifest rather than here, so this file does not
itself register as pytokio residue in the source-zero gates. Do not move them
into the Python.
