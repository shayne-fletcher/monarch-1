//! Blanket introspection protocol for hyperactor actors.
//!
//! Every actor automatically handles [`IntrospectMessage`] via a
//! blanket `Handler` implementation. The default response is
//! *structural*: it reports only framework-owned state (identity,
//! type, status, supervision parent/children) and is intended to be
//! cheap and safe to call on any actor at any time.
//!
//! Callers navigate topology by fetching a [`NodePayload`] and
//! following its `children` references. Children come in two forms:
//!
//! - **Addressable children** are actors with their own `ActorId` and
//!   mailbox. They can be introspected directly by sending
//!   [`IntrospectMessage::Query`] to that actor. The default handler
//!   reports these automatically.
//! - **Non-addressable children** are nodes a parent chooses to
//!   expose in `children` but which are not independently messageable
//!   (no mailbox / `ActorId`). These must be described indirectly via
//!   [`IntrospectMessage::QueryChild`], where the parent answers on
//!   the child's behalf (for example, a host exposing system procs
//!   that are not independently addressable actors).
//!
//! Actors that own non-addressable children, or that want to publish
//! domain-specific [`NodeProperties`] (e.g. `Host` or `Proc`),
//! override [`Actor::handle_introspect`].
