//! Introspection protocol for hyperactor actors.
//!
//! Every actor has a dedicated introspect task that handles
//! [`IntrospectMessage`] by reading [`InstanceCell`] state directly,
//! without going through the actor's message loop. This means:
//!
//! - Stuck actors can be introspected (the task runs independently).
//! - Introspection does not perturb observed state (no Heisenberg).
//! - Live status is reported accurately.
//!
//! Infrastructure actors publish domain-specific metadata via
//! [`PublishedProperties`], which the introspect task reads for
//! Entity-view queries. Non-addressable children (e.g., system procs)
//! are resolved via a callback registered on [`InstanceCell`].
//!
//! Callers navigate topology by fetching a [`NodePayload`] and
//! following its `children` references.
//!
//! # Design Invariants
//!
//! The introspection subsystem maintains eleven invariants (S1--S11).
//! Each is documented at the code site that enforces it.
//!
//! - **S1.** Introspection must not depend on actor responsiveness --
//!   a wedged actor can still be introspected (runtime task, not
//!   actor loop).
//! - **S2.** Introspection must not perturb observed state -- reading
//!   `InstanceCell` never sets `last_message_handler` to
//!   `IntrospectMessage`.
//! - **S3.** Sender routing is unchanged -- senders target the same
//!   `PortId` (`IntrospectMessage::port()`) across processes.
//! - **S4.** `IntrospectMessage` never produces a `WorkCell` --
//!   pre-registration via `open_message_port` gives the introspect
//!   port its own channel, independent of the actor's work queue.
//! - **S5.** Replies never use `PanickingMailboxSender` -- the
//!   introspect task replies via `Mailbox::serialize_and_send_once`.
//! - **S6.** View semantics are stable -- Actor view uses live
//!   structural state + supervision children; Entity view uses
//!   published properties + domain children.
//! - **S7.** `QueryChild` must work without actor handlers -- system
//!   procs are resolved via a per-actor callback on `InstanceCell`.
//! - **S8.** Published properties are constrained -- actors cannot
//!   publish `Root` or `Error` payloads (only `Host` and `Proc`
//!   variants).
//! - **S9.** Port binding is single source of truth -- the introspect
//!   port is bound exactly once via `bind_actor_port()` in
//!   `Instance::new()`.
//! - **S10.** Introspect receiver lifecycle -- created in
//!   `Instance::new()`, spawned in `start()`, dropped in
//!   `child_instance()`.
//! - **S11.** Terminated snapshots do not keep actors resolvable --
//!   `store_terminated_snapshot` writes to the proc's snapshot map,
//!   not the instances map. `resolve_actor_ref` checks terminal
//!   status independently and is unaffected by snapshot storage.

///
/// # Invariants
///
/// The failure introspection pipeline (from `serve()` in `proc.rs`
/// through this struct to the TUI) maintains six invariants. Each
/// is documented at its enforcement site with an `INV-N` comment.
///
/// - **FI-1 (event-before-status):** All `InstanceCell` state that
///   [`live_actor_payload`] reads must be written BEFORE
///   `change_status()` transitions to terminal. Enforced in
///   `proc.rs` `serve()`.
/// - **FI-2 (write-once):** `InstanceCellState::supervision_event`
///   is written at most once per actor lifetime. Enforced in
///   `proc.rs` `serve()` terminal paths.
/// - **FI-3 (failure_info ↔ actor_status):**
///   `failure_info.is_some()` iff
///   `actor_status.starts_with("failed:")`. Enforced in
///   [`live_actor_payload`].
/// - **FI-4 (is_propagated ↔ root_cause_actor):**
///   `is_propagated == true` iff `root_cause_actor !=
///   this_actor_id`. Enforced in [`live_actor_payload`].
/// - **FI-5 (is_poisoned ↔ failed_actor_count):**
///   `is_poisoned == true` iff `failed_actor_count > 0`. Enforced
///   in `mesh_agent.rs` `publish_introspect_properties()`.
/// - **FI-6 (clean stop = no artifacts):** When an actor stops
///   cleanly, `supervision_event` is `None`, `failure_info` is
///   `None`, and the actor does not contribute to
///   `failed_actor_count`.
