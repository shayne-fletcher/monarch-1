//! Private test-support bindings.
//!
//! Three unrelated pieces live here:
//!
//! 1. `TestStruct`, a minimal PyO3 struct for testing `@rust_struct` mixin
//!    patching. The `#[pyclass]` module is set to the Python file that defines
//!    the `@rust_struct`-decorated class so the name-validation check passes.
//! 2. `_HandleProbe`, a closed probe that mints a real Rust-produced `Handle`
//!    for the `Future`/`Handle` contract suite.
//! 3. `_make_delayed_handle`, a `Handle` that publishes after registering its
//!    first waiter, for the `returns_future` overhead benchmark.
//!
//! Everything here is private support: nothing is re-exported from `monarch`
//! and no production Python imports it.

///
/// * It must never accept arbitrary Python work -- no coroutine, awaitable,

///   contract fixture into a general async escape hatch, and every caller then
///   depends on this module staying compiled into production.
/// * It must never be cited as a real producer's oracle. Its timing is a
///   release gate and its outcomes are three fixed cases, so it says nothing
///   about when a real producer starts work or whether that work is abandoned
///   when nobody observes it. Those belong to the producer's own tests.
