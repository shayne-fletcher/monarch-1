//! GIL-free completion wake for `Handle.as_asyncio` (HDL-17 to HDL-21 in
//! [`crate::handle`]).
//!
//! Each asyncio loop that can watch a file descriptor (`loop.add_reader`,
//! which every selector-based loop, including all of Monarch's, provides) gets
//! one [`LoopWake`]: a queue of `u64` tokens and a non-blocking pipe whose read
//! end the loop watches. A loop without `add_reader` keeps the
//! `call_soon_threadsafe` path (HDL-21).
//!
//! `waker` and `read_fd` are the two ends of the pipe; `tx` and `rx` are the
//! two ends of the token queue. When a `Handle` completes, its Tokio observer
//! pushes its token and writes one byte to the pipe ([`Notifier::notify`]),
//! without the GIL. The byte only wakes the loop; the queue says which awaits
//! completed. The loop's reader drains the pipe, then the queue, and settles
//! the future of each completed await.
//!
//! The loop's selector is the channel's only strong owner, through its
//! `on_readable` callback. The registry holds the loop as a weak key and the
//! channel through a weak reference. Each entry holds its pending await's
//! future strongly, because that reference is the waiting task's only owner
//! outside the task's own cycle; asyncio holds tasks weakly. Closing the loop
//! therefore releases the channel, its pipe, its entries and their futures,
//! and `__traverse__` lets the garbage collector free an unclosed loop
//! (HDL-19, which also records the case that is not freed):
//!
//! ```text
//! registry:         weak(loop) ──▶ weak(LoopWake)
//! loop's selector:  read_fd    ──▶ LoopWake.on_readable
//!
//! LoopWake
//!   ├─ tx / rx    queue of u64 tokens
//!   ├─ waker      pipe write end, shared with every Notifier
//!   ├─ read_fd    pipe read end, registered with `add_reader`
//!   └─ entries    token → (asyncio future, Handle)
//! ```
