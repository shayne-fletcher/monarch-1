//! `Handle`: an observe-only handle to a background Tokio task.
//!
//! A `Handle` wraps a `watch` channel that a producer fulfills exactly once with
//! the task's `PyResult<Py<PyAny>>`. You observe its eventual result:
//! synchronously via `get()`, on an `asyncio` loop via `as_asyncio()`/`await`, or
//! without blocking via `poll()`. The channel is multi-observer, so a resolved
//! value stays observable by any number of later observers.
//!
//! The watch-channel mechanics live in [`HandleCore`].
//!
//! ## Handle invariants (HDL-*)
//!
//! Code that relies on or enforces an invariant is tagged `// HDL-N`, and each
//! `#[cfg(test)]` test that attests one names it; read the matching entry below
//! before changing a tagged site.
//!
//! Assumed of the shared core and producer (not enforced here):
//! - **HDL-1 (single terminal completion).** The watch value goes `None` ->
//!   `Some(_)` exactly once and is never reset (`Some` -> `Some`, `Some` ->
//!   `None`). Relied on by [`HandleCore::wait_future`] (wait loop + `expect`) and
//!   [`HandleCore::poll`] (re-borrow across the GIL). Held by convention: every
//!   producer sends once, always `Some(_)`. A send-once sender (a newtype
//!   consuming the `watch::Sender`) could make it structural, hardening `poll`'s
//!   re-borrow.
//! - **HDL-2 (value encoding).** `None` is pending, `Some(Ok(_))` success,
//!   `Some(Err(_))` a producer error.
//!
//! Guaranteed by this module:
//! - **HDL-3 (non-consuming reads).** Every read clones the value out
//!   (`clone_ref`) rather than moving it, so any number of observers see the
//!   same result. Enforced by construction: no read path moves the value.
//! - **HDL-4 (drop does not cancel; drop never panics).** Dropping a `Handle`
//!   never cancels its producer; a `Handle` observes, it does not own the
//!   producer's lifecycle. Enforced by construction: a `Handle`'s core has
//!   `abort_on_drop: None`, and `HandleCore::Drop` aborts only when
//!   `abort_on_drop` is set. The abort is wrapped in `catch_unwind`, so an
//!   `abort()` that panics at interpreter shutdown (the Tokio runtime already
//!   gone) cannot escape `Drop` and abort the process.
//! - **HDL-5 (GIL discipline).** No Python object is touched without the GIL,
//!   and every acquisition goes through `monarch_with_gil{,_blocking}`. Enforced
//!   by the crate's `#![deny(clippy::disallowed_methods)]` ban on raw
//!   `Python::with_gil`/`attach` -- a hard compile error, not a `debug_assert`.
//! - **HDL-6 (`WouldBlockRuntime` is `get()`'s alone).** Only `get()` raises it,
//!   and only in a Tokio runtime context; `as_asyncio()`/`__await__` off a loop
//!   raise the native `RuntimeError` instead.
//! - **HDL-7 (`as_asyncio` publish).** The observer waits borrow-first (via
//!   `wait_ready`, never `changed()`-first) and sets a result only on a
//!   non-cancelled future, swallowing `InvalidStateError`; any `StopIteration`
//!   (including subclasses) is wrapped in `RuntimeError` first, since
//!   `set_exception` rejects `StopIteration` (PEP 479); if the loop has closed it
//!   logs rather than panics.
//! - **HDL-8 (`get()` loop-warning is call-pattern, not outcome).** `get()` on a
//!   running asyncio loop warns regardless of whether the value is ready: it
//!   flags the blocking-call-from-a-loop anti-pattern, not whether this call
//!   happens to block. A ready value returns after warning; under a
//!   warnings-as-errors filter the warning escalates to an error.
//! - **HDL-9 (GIL/watch borrow discipline).** A `watch` borrow is never held
//!   across a GIL acquisition or an `.await`. `poll` drops its read guard before
//!   taking the GIL and re-borrows under it (GIL-then-watch order, never the
//!   inverse against the producer's write-lock `send`); the `wait_ready`/
//!   `wait_future` loops drop the temporary `Ref` before each `.await`; and their
//!   returned futures own a cloned receiver (`Send + 'static`, borrowing nothing
//!   from `&self`), which is what lets `get()` `drop(slf)` + release the GIL
//!   before blocking and lets `as_asyncio` `spawn` the observer. Enforced partly
//!   by the compiler (`Send` bounds, the borrow checker on `drop(slf)`) and
//!   partly by construction; exercised by the multi-observer/blocking tests.
//! - **HDL-10 (dropped producer surfaces, never hangs).** If every producer drops
//!   its sender without sending, the wait loop's `changed().await?` yields a
//!   `RecvError` turned into a Python exception (`to_py_error`) on both the sync
//!   (`get`/`wait_future`) and async (`as_asyncio`) paths, so an observer raises
//!   rather than hanging forever.
//! - **HDL-11 (`Handle` is not constructible from Python).** The pyclass has no
//!   `#[new]` and the only `from_value` constructor is `#[cfg(test)]`-gated, so a
//!   live `Handle` always wraps a producer-supplied core (upholding HDL-1/HDL-2);
//!   exposing a Python constructor would let user code mint an unresolvable core.
//! - **HDL-12 (`get()` timeout contract).** `get()` validates the timeout up
//!   front (rejecting negative/NaN/non-finite as `ValueError` via
//!   `try_from_secs_f64`, never panicking) and before the ready fast path, so an
//!   invalid timeout raises deterministically even for a ready handle. A timeout
//!   is non-cancelling: it raises `TimeoutError` while leaving the producer and
//!   every observer untouched, so a later `poll()`/`get()`/`await` still observes
//!   completion.
