// `LoggingMeshClient` is a thin owner for three pieces of logging
// infra:
//
//   - `client_actor`: a single `LogClientActor` in the *local*
//     process.
//   - `forwarder_mesh`: (optional) an `ActorMesh<LogForwardActor>`
//     with one actor per remote proc in the `ProcMesh`, responsible for
//     forwarding that proc's stdout/stderr back to the client.
//   - `logger_mesh`: an `ActorMesh<LoggerRuntimeActor>` with one
//     actor per remote proc, responsible for driving that proc's Python
//     logging configuration.
//
// The Python-facing handle we hand back to callers is a
// `Py<LoggingMeshClient>`. When that handle is dropped (or goes out
// of scope in a test), PyO3 will run `Drop` for `LoggingMeshClient`.
//
// Important:
//
// - In `Drop` we *only* call `drain_and_stop()` on the local
//   `LogClientActor`. This asks the client-side aggregator to
//   flush/stop so we don't leave a local task running.
// - We do NOT synchronously tear down the per-proc meshes here.
//   Dropping `forwarder_mesh` / `logger_mesh` just releases our
//   handles; the actual `LogForwardActor` / `LoggerRuntimeActor`
//   instances keep running on the remote procs until those procs are
//   shut down.
//
// This is fine in tests because we always shut the world down
// afterward via `host_mesh.shutdown(&instance)`, which tears down the
// spawned procs and all actors running in them. In other words:
//
//   drop(Py<LoggingMeshClient>)
//     → stops the local `LogClientActor`, drops mesh handles
//   host_mesh.shutdown(...)
//     → kills the remote procs, which takes out the per-proc actors
//

// dropping `LoggingMeshClient` does *not* on its own tear down the
// remote logging actors; it only stops the local client actor.
