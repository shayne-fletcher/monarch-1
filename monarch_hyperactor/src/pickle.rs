//! Pickling support for Monarch.
//!
//! This module pickles Python objects for actor messages, collecting tensor
//! engine references and out-of-band mesh references during serialization so
//! they are restored together on decode.
//!
//! ## Out-of-band mesh-reference invariants
//!
//! Mesh references (proc/host/actor meshes) are not pickled inline. They ride
//! *out of band* in a `refs` table carried next to the payload bytes, leaving a
//! `pop_mesh_reference` sentinel in the pickle stream. Two invariants keep the
//! table and its payload from ever drifting apart:
//!
//! **REFS-1 (ref-aware decode).** Any payload that can carry out-of-band refs
//! must be decoded only through a ref-aware path: `PicklingState::from_parts`
//! and `PicklingState::unpickle`, as wrapped by `PythonMessage::decode` and
//! `PythonResponseMessage::decode`. A bare `pickle.loads`/`cloudpickle.loads`
//! on the payload bytes drops the table, so a sentinel later pops with no active
//! state and raises "No active pickling state". The raw payload bytes are
//! deliberately not exposed on `PythonMessage` (there is no `.message` getter),
//! so a bare decode is not even expressible from Python.
//!
//! **REFS-2 (refs preserved through intermediates).** Any intermediate that
//! relays a payload -- `PythonResponseMessage` and the `ValueOverlay` behind a
//! `.call()` valuemesh -- must carry its `refs` beside the bytes, all the way to
//! the decode site. Dropping refs at a relay boundary reintroduces the REFS-1
//! failure downstream. Refs are therefore part of `PythonResponseMessage`
//! equality: two runs with identical bytes but different refs must not coalesce.
//!
//! These invariants have one sound exception. A table entry and a
//! `pop_mesh_reference` sentinel are emitted together during pickling (1:1),
//! so an empty `refs` table means the payload carries no sentinels: a bare
//! decode of it pops nothing and is sound. The `.call()` valuemesh collector
//! (`collect_valuemesh` in `endpoint.rs`) relies on this to preserve
//! D96180139's lazy unpickle: it decodes a ref-empty batch lazily via
//! `PyValueMesh::build_from_parts` (`value_mesh.rs`), which resolves on access
//! outside the ref-aware path, and only a ref-carrying batch eagerly via
//! `build_from_objects`. That lazy build is the sole bare decode of a payload
//! that *could* carry refs; see `collect_valuemesh` for the gate itself.
