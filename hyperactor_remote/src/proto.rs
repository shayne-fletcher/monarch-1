//! Message types for remote supervision sessions.
//!
//! A remote supervision relationship is represented by one worker actor
//! supervising one child actor on behalf of one supervisor. The supervisor
//! initiates the relationship by sending [`Supervise`] to the worker. The
//! `supervisor` port in [`Supervise`] identifies the session endpoint that the
//! worker uses for all replies and supervision events. The `liveness` spec in
//! [`Supervise`] identifies the implementation actor that the worker spawns as
//! the session liveness mechanism. Later supervisor commands are sent to the
//! worker as [`WorkerCommand`] messages and carry the same `session_id`; the
//! worker accepts only the active session.
