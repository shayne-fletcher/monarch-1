//! Exercises the execution surface (real Python hooks end-to-end) by
//! spawning the `execution_workload` Python binary and steering it
//! through the stdin-command / stdout-sentinel handshake
//! (`WorkloadFixture::send_command` / `wait_for_stdout`). NO sleeps:
//! every poll happens only after the relevant `EXEC_ENTERED` /
//! `EXEC_ACK` sentinel, so it proves mesh-admin truth rather than
//! winning a timing race.
//!
//! Unlike the `ExecutionTracker` unit tests (aggregation, oldest-first
//! ordering, truncation, the `0` sentinel, idempotent `finish`) and the
//! DTO json-shape tests, this proves the *real* `_Actor.handle` bracket
//! increments the `execution` surface on entry and decrements on exit
//! (completion and exception), across direct dispatch, queue dispatch,
//! and `@concurrent_endpoint`, visible end-to-end through
//! `GET /v1/{actor}` and the typed actor node payload.
//!
//! Cancellation is actor-fatal in the current runtime (`CancelledError`
//! is a `BaseException` -> the `except BaseException` arm re-raises -> a
//! kill signal), so it cannot be observed as `active_count -> 0` on a
//! surviving actor; the framework `finally` still decrements first (no
//! leak -- the cell is torn down with the actor anyway), and that
//! decrement path is covered by the `ExecutionTracker` unit tests.
//!
//! Coverage:
//!   - direct dispatch: one held invocation -> `active_count` 1, populated row.
//!   - same-name aggregation: two held `hold`s -> `active_count` 2, ONE row
//!     at row `active_count == 2`.
//!   - completion decrement: release each -> count drops; after the last
//!     release the supported-but-idle shape returns (`Some`, count 0).
//!   - exception decrement: raise a held invocation (via `call_one`, so
//!     the handler error returns as `ActorError` and the actor survives)
//!     -> count drops back to the idle shape.
//!   - queue dispatch: one held invocation -> `active_count` 1 (the
//!     bracket fires in queue mode too).
//!   - concurrent endpoint under queue dispatch: two held `hold`s overlap,
//!     aggregate to one row with `active_count == 2`, and can be released by
//!     a later control message on the same actor without deadlocking.
//!   - queue-dispatch deadlock: a blocking plain `@endpoint` monopolizes the
//!     Python dispatch loop, so a later release can never run; the API surfaces
//!     the wedge as `execution.active_count` pinned at 1 on the same invocation
//!     (the stuck release is not introspectable -- `queue_depth` is the Rust
//!     work queue, which drains before the handler runs).
//!   - idle sibling: `Some` with `active_count == 0` (EX-1: a supported
//!     actor that is idle is `Some`, not `None`).
