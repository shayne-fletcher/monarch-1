//! Host lifecycle management for procs running on one machine.
//!
//! A [`Host`] owns one [`Gateway`] and one [`ProcManager`]. The manager makes
//! procs real, either by spawning them in-process for tests or by launching
//! separate OS processes. The gateway owns connectivity: it serves the backend
//! and frontend endpoints, multiplexes inbound traffic to in-process procs,
//! and routes spawned child proc gateways through peer routes.
//!
//! Use [`Host::new`] or [`Host::new_with_gateway`] to construct a host, start its
//! backend and frontend accept loops, then [`Host::spawn`] to create child procs.
//! Spawned children are returned as [`ProcAddr`] values whose location is
//! advertised through this host's gateway.
//!
//! ## Gateway topology
//!
//! A host gateway exposes a frontend endpoint `*` and serves a backend
//! endpoint `#` for child proc gateways. Each spawned child has its own
//! gateway endpoint (`#1`, `#2`, ...), uses `#` as its forwarder, and is
//! advertised as `Via(child_uid, host_location)`. The `host_location` is the
//! host gateway's advertised location: the newest active frontend serve or
//! `serve_via` session.
//!
//! The host gateway keeps one peer route per child uid. When it receives a
//! message for `Via(child_uid, host_location)`, it peels the child hop and
//! forwards the envelope to the child's gateway. In-process service and local
//! procs are delivered through the gateway's local proc table.
//!
//! ```text
//! inbound to host_location
//! (*, or Via(...) when attached)
//!          |
//!          v
//!   +---------------+     peer child_uid_1 -> #1     +----------------------+
//!   | Host Gateway  |------------------------------->| child gateway/proc 1 |
//!   | local procs:  |                                | addr #1              |
//!   | service/local |<-------------------------------| forwarder -> #       |
//!   +---------------+          host backend #         +----------------------+
//!          |
//!          | peer child_uid_2 -> #2
//!          v
//!   +----------------------+
//!   | child gateway/proc 2 |
//!   | addr #2              |
//!   | forwarder -> #       |
//!   +----------------------+
//! ```
//!
//! The built-in service and local procs are created during construction and
//! run in-process on the host gateway. The local proc starts with no actors; a
//! `ProcAgent` and root client actor are added lazily when
//! `HostMeshAgent::handle(GetLocalProc)` first asks for it.
