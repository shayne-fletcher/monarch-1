//! Messages used in supervision of actor meshes.
//!
//! ## Mesh-name propagation
//!
//! When a `MeshFailure` is constructed for a supervision event
//! whose constructing site has the mesh name locally in scope, the
//! mesh name is carried on `MeshFailure.actor_mesh_name`. The
//! constructing site does not perform a lookup to obtain the mesh
//! name; if the mesh name is not locally available at the site,
//! `None` is correct. `MeshFailure::Display` surfaces the mesh
//! name as an `on mesh "{name}"` segment when `actor_mesh_name`
//! is populated; stable identifiers continue to appear in detail
//! segments where the renderer already includes them.
//! Python-binding-specific plumbing for this carrier — how a
//! Python-spawned actor ends up with a mesh base-name string to
//! supply — lives in `monarch_hyperactor/src/actor.rs`
//! (`PythonActorParams.mesh_base_name`).
//!
//! ## Attribution-transport invariants (AT-*)
//!
//! Refs carry structured attribution as `Attrs`; envelopes carry
//! the same declared keys as `Flattrs` headers; synthesis
//! boundaries may project transport values into the event-level
//! `Attribution` struct in `hyperactor/src/supervision.rs`. The
//! `Attribution` carrier is a neutral shape; the transport
//! vocabulary feeding it today is destination-side (see AT-3).
//!
//! - **AT-1 (declared-key-only transport).**
//!   Supervision-path attribution transport uses only declared
//!   keys that participate in the declaration-driven
//!   attribution-header vocabulary: a declared attr key joins the
//!   vocabulary by carrying the shared
//!   `hyperactor_config::attrs::ATTRIBUTION_HEADER` meta tag (see
//!   the `DEST_*` declarations below for the idiom). The same
//!   declared key addresses the same attribution dimension on both
//!   the ref-level `Attrs` and the envelope-level `Flattrs`:
//!   stamping and hoisting copy values by key and do not
//!   reinterpret, rename, or synthesize. No stringly-typed ad-hoc
//!   keys, no parsing of rendered output, no identifier-text
//!   recovery.
//!
//!   Enforcement is mechanical. One shared marker-driven stamping /
//!   copying mechanism in `hyperactor_config::attrs`
//!   (`stamp_marked_attrs_into_flattrs`, `copy_marked_flattrs`)
//!   filters on the marker at every use site; entries whose
//!   declared key lacks the marker are silently skipped. Cast,
//!   comm-forwarding, comm-hoist, and substrate direct-send paths
//!   all go through that one mechanism, either via the mesh helpers
//!   in this module (`stamp_attribution_into`,
//!   `stamp_attribution_from_headers`,
//!   `hoist_attribution_onto_envelope`) or via the substrate
//!   direct-send stamper
//!   (`hyperactor::reference::stamp_ref_attribution_onto`). None
//!   has a private key set. The substrate imports no `DEST_*` name;
//!   `hyperactor_mesh` declares them and joins the vocabulary by
//!   marking them.
//!
//! - **AT-3 (current transport vocabulary is destination-side).**
//!   The `DEST_*` keys describe the destination actor/ref the
//!   message is being sent to, not the sender.
//!
//! - **AT-4 (identity independence).**
//!   Ref attribution (`Attrs` on `ActorRef`/`PortRef`/
//!   `OncePortRef`/`ActorMeshRef`) does not participate in ref
//!   identity, equality, ordering, or hashing.
//!
//! - **AT-5 (no lookup during propagation or synthesis).**
//!   Cast, direct-send, comm-forwarding, root-client
//!   undeliverable, and controller-unreachable paths propagate or
//!   project only the structured keys already present on
//!   refs/headers. They do not perform a lookup to recover
//!   attribution. If a value is not locally present, `None` at the
//!   event layer is correct.
