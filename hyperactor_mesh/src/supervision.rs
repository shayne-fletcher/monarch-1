//! Messages used in supervision of actor meshes.
//!
//! The substrate-level failure-attribution invariants (FA-*) live
//! in `hyperactor/src/supervision.rs`. This module layers the
//! mesh-specific interpretation of those invariants on top.
//!
//! ## Mesh-specific FA-1 (mesh-name propagation).
//!
//! When a `MeshFailure` is constructed for a supervision event
//! whose constructing site has the mesh name locally in scope, the
//! mesh name is carried on `MeshFailure.actor_mesh_name`. The
//! constructing site does not perform a lookup to obtain the mesh
//! name; if the mesh name is not locally available at the site,
//! `None` is correct (consistent with FA-1 in
//! `hyperactor/src/supervision.rs`). `MeshFailure::Display`
//! surfaces the mesh name as an `on mesh "{name}"` segment when
//! `actor_mesh_name` is populated; stable identifiers continue to
//! appear in detail segments where the renderer already includes
//! them (consistent with FA-3). Python-binding-specific plumbing
//! for this carrier — how a Python-spawned actor ends up with a
//! mesh base-name string to supply — lives in
//! `monarch_hyperactor/src/actor.rs` (`PythonActorParams.mesh_base_name`).
