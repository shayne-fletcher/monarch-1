//! Mesh-level admin surface for topology introspection and reference
//! walking.
//!
//! This module defines `MeshAdminAgent`, an actor that exposes a
//! uniform, reference-based HTTP API over an entire host mesh. Every
//! addressable entity in the mesh is represented as a `NodePayload`
//! and resolved via typed `NodeRef` references (parsed from HTTP
//! path strings at the request boundary).
//!
//! Incoming HTTP requests are bridged into the actor message loop
//! using `ResolveReferenceMessage`, ensuring that all topology
//! resolution and data collection happens through actor messaging.
//! The agent fans out to `HostAgent` instances to fetch host,
//! proc, and actor details, then normalizes them into a single
//! tree-shaped model (`NodeProperties` + children references)
//! suitable for topology-agnostic clients such as the admin TUI.
//!
//! # Schema strategy
//!
//! The external API contract is schema-first: the JSON Schema
//! (Draft 2020-12) served at `GET /v1/schema` is the
//! authoritative definition of the response shape. The error
//! envelope schema is at `GET /v1/schema/error`.
//!
//! Schema and OpenAPI are derived from the HTTP boundary DTO types
//! in [`crate::introspect::dto`] (`NodePayloadDto`,
//! `NodePropertiesDto`, `FailureInfoDto`) via
//! `schemars::JsonSchema`. The domain types (`NodePayload`,
//! `NodeProperties`, `FailureInfo`) do not carry `JsonSchema` —
//! they own the typed internal model; the DTOs own the wire
//! contract.
//!
//! This follows the "Admin Gateway Pattern" RFC
//! ([doc](https://fburl.com/1dvah88uutaiyesebojouen2)):
//! schema is the product; transports and tooling are projections.
//!
//! ## Schema generation pipeline
//!
//! 1. `#[derive(JsonSchema)]` on `NodePayloadDto`,
//!    `NodePropertiesDto`, `FailureInfoDto`, `ApiError`,
//!    `ApiErrorEnvelope`.
//! 2. `schemars::schema_for!(T)` produces a `Schema` value at
//!    runtime (Draft 2020-12).
//! 3. The `serve_schema` / `serve_error_schema` handlers inject a
//!    `$id` field (SC-4) and serve the result as JSON.
//! 4. Snapshot tests in `introspect::tests` compare the raw
//!    schemars output (without `$id`) against checked-in golden
//!    files to detect drift (SC-2).
//! 5. Validation tests construct domain payloads, convert to DTOs,
//!    and confirm the serialized DTOs pass schema validation
//!    (SC-3).
//!
//! ## Regenerating snapshots
//!
//! After intentional changes to the DTO types
//! (`NodePayloadDto`, `NodePropertiesDto`, `FailureInfoDto`),
//! `ApiError`, or `ApiErrorEnvelope`, regenerate the golden
//! files:
//!
//! ```sh
//! buck run fbcode//monarch/hyperactor_mesh:generate_api_artifacts \
//!   @fbcode//mode/dev-nosan -- \
//!   fbcode/monarch/hyperactor_mesh/src/testdata
//! ```
//!
//! Or via cargo:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p hyperactor_mesh --bin generate_api_artifacts -- \
//!   hyperactor_mesh/src/testdata
//! ```
//!
//! Then re-run tests to confirm the new snapshot passes.
//!
//! ## Schema invariants (SC-*)
//!
//! - **SC-1 (schema-derived):** Schema is derived from the DTO
//!   types via `schemars::JsonSchema`, not hand-written.
//! - **SC-2 (schema-snapshot-stability):** Schema changes must
//!   be explicit — a snapshot test catches unintentional drift.
//! - **SC-3 (schema-payload-conformance):** Domain payloads
//!   converted to DTOs validate against the generated schema.
//! - **SC-4 (schema-version-identity):** Served schemas carry a
//!   `$id` tied to the API version (e.g.
//!   `https://monarch.meta.com/schemas/v1/node_payload`).
//! - **SC-5 (route-precedence):** Literal schema routes are
//!   matched by specificity before the `{*reference}` wildcard
//!   (axum 0.8 specificity-based routing).
//!
//! Note on `ApiError.details`: the derived schema is maximally
//! permissive for `details` (any valid JSON). This is intentional
//! for v1 — `details` is a domain-specific escape hatch.
//! Consumers must not assume a fixed shape.
//!
//! # Introspection visibility policy
//!
//! Admin tooling only displays **introspectable** nodes: entities
//! that are reachable via actor messaging and respond to
//! [`IntrospectMessage`]. Infrastructure procs that are
//! **non-routable** are intentionally **opaque** to introspection and
//! are omitted from the navigation graph.
//!
//! ## Definitions
//!
//! **Routable** — an entity is routable if the system can address it
//! via the routing layer and successfully deliver a message to it
//! using a `Reference` / `ActorId` (i.e., there exists a live mailbox
//! sender reachable through normal routing). Practical test: "can I
//! send `IntrospectMessage::Query` to it and get a reply?"
//!
//! **Non-routable** — an entity is non-routable if it has no
//! externally reachable mailbox sender in the routing layer, so
//! message delivery is impossible by construction (even if you know
//! its name). Examples: `hyperactor_runtime[0]`, `mailbox_server[N]`,
//! `local[N]` — these use `PanickingMailboxSender` and are never
//! bound to the router.
//!
//! **Introspectable** — tooling can obtain a `NodePayload` for this
//! node by sending `IntrospectMessage` to a routable actor.
//!
//! **Opaque** — the node exists but is not introspectable via
//! messaging; tooling cannot observe it through the introspection
//! protocol.
//!
//! ## Proc visibility
//!
//! A proc is not directly introspected; actors are. Tooling
//! synthesizes proc-level nodes by grouping introspectable actors by
//! `ProcId`.
//!
//! A proc is visible iff there exists at least one actor on that proc
//! whose `ActorId` is deliverable via the routing layer (i.e., the
//! actor has a bound mailbox sender reachable through normal routing)
//! and responds to `IntrospectMessage`.
//!
//! The rule is: **if an entity is routable via the mesh routing layer
//! (i.e., tooling can deliver `IntrospectMessage::Query` to one of its
//! actors), then it is introspectable and appears in the admin graph.**
//!
//! ## Navigation identity invariants (NI-*)
//!
//! Every `NodePayload` in the topology tree satisfies:
//!
//! - **NI-1 (identity = reference):** A node's `identity: NodeRef`
//!   must correspond to the reference used to resolve it. The
//!   display form of `identity` round-trips through `NodeRef::from_str`.
//!
//! - **NI-2 (parent = containment parent):** A node's
//!   `parent: Option<NodeRef>` records its canonical containment
//!   parent, not the inverse of every navigation edge. Specifically:
//!   root → `None`, host → `Root`, proc → `Host(…)`,
//!   actor → `Proc(…)`. An actor's parent is always its owning proc,
//!   even when the actor also appears as a child of another actor via
//!   supervision.
//!
//! - **NI-3 (children = navigation graph):** A node's `children`
//!   is the admin navigation graph. Actor-to-actor supervision links
//!   coexist with proc→actor membership links without changing
//!   `parent`. The same actor may therefore appear in `children` of
//!   both its proc and its supervising actor.
//!
//! Together these ensure that the TUI can correlate responses to tree
//! nodes, and that upward/downward navigation is consistent.
//!
//! ## Link-classification invariants (LC-*)
//!
//! These describe which nodes emit `system_children` and
//! `stopped_children` classification sets, and what those sets
//! contain.
//!
//! - **LC-1 (root system_children empty):** Root payloads always
//!   emit `system_children: vec![]`. Root children are host nodes,
//!   which are not classified as system.
//!
//! - **LC-2 (host system_children empty):** Host payloads always
//!   emit `system_children: vec![]`. Host children are procs, which
//!   are not classified as system — only actors carry the system
//!   classification.
//!
//! - **LC-3 (proc system_children subset):** Proc payloads emit
//!   `system_children ⊆ children`, containing only `NodeRef::Actor`
//!   refs where `cell.is_system()` is true.
//!
//! - **LC-4 (proc stopped_children subset):** Proc payloads emit
//!   `stopped_children ⊆ children`, containing only
//!   `NodeRef::Actor` refs for terminated actors retained for
//!   post-mortem inspection.
//!
//! - **LC-5 (actor/error no classification sets):** Actor and Error
//!   payloads do not carry `system_children` or `stopped_children`.
//!
//! ## Proc-resolution invariants (SP-*)
//!
//! When a proc reference is resolved, the returned `NodePayload`
//! satisfies:
//!
//! - **SP-1 (identity):** The identity matches the ProcId reference
//!   from the parent's children list.
//! - **SP-2 (properties):** The properties are `NodeProperties::Proc`.
//! - **SP-3 (parent):** The parent is `NodeRef::Host(actor_id)`.
//! - **SP-4 (as_of):** The `as_of` field is present and valid
//!   (internally `SystemTime`; serialized as ISO 8601 string over
//!   the HTTP JSON API per HB-1).
//!
//! Enforced by `test_system_proc_identity`.
//!
//! ## Proc-agent invariants (PA-*)
//!
//! - **PA-1 (live children):** Proc-node children used by admin/TUI
//!   must be derived from live proc state at query time. No
//!   additional publish event is required for a newly spawned actor
//!   to appear.
//!
//! Enforced by `test_proc_children_reflect_directly_spawned_actors`.
//!
//! ## Robustness invariant (MA-R1)
//!
//! - **MA-R1 (no-crash):** `MeshAdminAgent` must never crash the OS
//!   process it resides in. Every handler catches errors and converts
//!   them into structured error payloads
//!   (`ResolveReferenceResponse(Err(..))`, `NodeProperties::Error`,
//!   etc.) rather than propagating panics or unwinding. Failed reply
//!   sends (the caller went away) are silently swallowed.
//!
//! ## TLS transport invariant (MA-T1)
//!
//! - **MA-T1 (tls):** At Meta (`fbcode_build`), the admin HTTP
//!   server **requires** mutual TLS. At startup it probes for
//!   certificates via `try_tls_acceptor` with client cert
//!   enforcement enabled. If no usable certificate bundle is found,
//!   `init()` returns an error — no plain HTTP fallback. In OSS,
//!   TLS is best-effort with plain HTTP fallback.
//!
//! - **MA-T2 (scheme-in-url):** The URL returned by `GetAdminAddr`
//!   is always `https://host:port` or `http://host:port`, never a
//!   bare `host:port`. All callers receive and use this full URL
//!   directly.
//!
//! ## Client host invariants (CH-*)
//!
//! Let **A** denote the aggregated host set (the union of hosts
//! from all meshes passed to [`host_mesh::spawn_admin`],
//! deduplicated by `HostAgent` `ActorId` — see SA-3), and let
//! **C** denote the process-global singleton client host mesh in
//! the caller process (whose local proc hosts the root client
//! actor).
//!
//! - **CH-1 (deduplication):** When C ∈ A, the client host appears
//!   exactly once in the admin host list (deduplicated by `HostAgent`
//!   `ActorId` identity). When C ∉ A, `spawn_admin` includes C
//!   alongside A's hosts so the admin introspects C as a normal host
//!   subtree, not as a standalone proc.
//!
//! - **CH-2 (reachability):** In both cases, the root client actor
//!   is reachable through the standard host → proc → actor walk.
//!
//! - **CH-3 (ordering):** C must be initialized before
//!   `spawn_admin` executes. In Rust, calling `context()` /
//!   `this_host()` / `this_proc()` triggers `GLOBAL_CONTEXT`
//!   bootstrap, which initializes C. In Python, `bootstrap_host()`
//!   calls `register_client_host()` before any actor code runs.
//!   Either path ensures C is available by the time `spawn_admin`
//!   reads it via `try_this_host()`. Any refactor must preserve
//!   this ordering.
//!
//! - **CH-4 (runtime-agnostic client-host discovery):** `spawn_admin`
//!   discovers C via `try_this_host()`, which checks two sources
//!   in order: the Rust `GLOBAL_CONTEXT` (initialized via
//!   `context()` / `this_host()` / `this_proc()`) and the
//!   externally registered client host (set by
//!   `register_client_host()` from Python's `bootstrap_host()`).
//!   Aggregation logic must not branch on which source provided C.
//!
//! **Mechanism:** [`host_mesh::spawn_admin`] aggregates hosts from
//! all input meshes (SA-3), reads C from the caller process (via
//! `try_this_host()`), merges it with the aggregated set (SA-6),
//! deduplicates by `HostAgent` `ActorId`, and spawns the
//! `MeshAdminAgent` on the caller's local proc via
//! `cx.instance().proc().spawn(...)`. Placement now follows the
//! caller context rather than mesh topology.
//!
//! ## Spawn/aggregation invariants (SA-*)
//!
//! [`host_mesh::spawn_admin`] aggregates hosts from one or more
//! meshes into a single admin host set.
//!
//! - **SA-1 (non-empty mesh set):** The input must yield at least
//!   one mesh.
//! - **SA-2 (non-empty hosts):** Every input mesh must contain at
//!   least one host.
//! - **SA-3 (host-agent identity dedup):** The admin host set is
//!   the ordered union of host agents from all input meshes,
//!   deduplicated by `HostAgent` `ActorId` in first-seen order.
//! - **SA-4 (single-mesh degeneracy):** `spawn_admin([mesh], ...)`
//!   is behaviorally equivalent to the former `mesh.spawn_admin(...)`.
//!   Established by existing single-mesh integration tests (e.g.
//!   `dining_philosophers`); no dedicated unit test.
//! - **SA-5 (caller-local placement):** The admin is spawned on the
//!   caller's local proc — the `Proc` of the actor context passed to
//!   `spawn_admin()`. In common remote launch flows, the caller is
//!   typically the root client/control process.
//! - **SA-6 (client-host merge after aggregation):** Client-host
//!   inclusion/dedup (CH-1) operates on the already-aggregated host
//!   set, not per-mesh independently.
//!
//! ## MAST resolution (disabled)
//!
//! `mast_conda:///` resolution is disabled. The old topology-based
//! resolution assumed the admin lived on the first mesh head host,
//! which is no longer true after SA-5 changed to caller-local
//! placement. All resolution paths now return explicit errors.
//! A publication-based discovery mechanism will replace this in a
//! future change. Until then, discover the admin URL from
//! startup output or another launch-time publication.
//!
//! ## Admin self-identification invariants (AI-*)
//!
//! - **AI-1 (live identity):** `GET /v1/admin` returns the live
//!   admin actor identity as `AdminInfo`.
//! - **AI-2 (reported proc):** `proc_id` reports the hosting proc.
//!   Placement equality (SA-5) is proved by unit tests; integration
//!   tests validate that `proc_id` is populated and well-formed.
//! - **AI-3 (url consistency):** `url` matches `GetAdminAddr`.
//!
//! The relationship between `host` and `url` (formerly AI-4) is
//! now a constructor guarantee of [`AdminInfo::new`] rather than a
//! live invariant. It is not in this registry.
