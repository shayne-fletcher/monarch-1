//! Pipelined-chain bulk broadcast over hyperactor's channel transport.
//!
//! A leader streams a large block down an ordered chain of workers --
//! `leader -> worker[0] -> worker[1] -> ... -> worker[N-1]` -- where each
//! interior worker forwards every chunk to its successor the instant it lands
//! (temporal pipelining), so the source egresses ~one copy regardless of N.
//! This is the bandwidth-optimal large-block broadcast (NCCL's ring, MPI's
//! pipelined chain); it replaces a single-leader O(N) fan-out.
//!
//! Unlike a bolt-on transport, this reuses [`hyperactor::channel`]: connections
//! are persistent channel streams (the process default transport -- metatls in
//! cluster, for Meta mutual-TLS identity with no cert paths to read -- or any
//! transport `serve` is given), framing and reconnect live in the channel layer,
//! and addresses are exchanged as plain strings. The only new machinery here is the
//! chunk relay ([`forward`]) and a byte-counter recv-completion signal
//! ([`new_ctx`]/[`ctx_wait_into`]).
//!
//! The Python surface mirrors the C transport it supersedes so the remotemount
//! orchestration is unchanged: `serve` (bind a listener), `connect` (dial the
//! head/successor), `send_block` (prime the pipeline at the source), `forward`
//! (relay + deliver at each worker), and `new_ctx`/`ctx_wait_into`/`ctx_close`.
