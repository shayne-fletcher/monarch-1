//! Drives one runtime-neutral QUIC endpoint and translates between application operations and
//! packet I/O.
//!
//! `EndpointHandle` is the application boundary. Its command and stream-submission handles feed
//! one bounded FIFO, and its completion queue carries command results, operation results, and
//! unsolicited lifecycle events back to the application. The queue types in
//! `chrysalis_transport_core` provide admission, correlation IDs, retained-byte accounting, and a
//! reserved terminal-completion slot for every accepted operation. This module preserves that
//! ownership while `Endpoint::poll` serializes all mutable protocol work on one driver thread.
//!
//! The layers below the endpoint have narrower responsibilities:
//!
//! - `Network` owns the connection table, connection-ID routes, QUIC timers, and conversion between
//!   quiche packets and `PacketIo` datagrams.
//! - `ConnectionState` owns per-stream ordering and the independent send and receive halves. It
//!   advances only streams that application submissions, quiche readiness, or released send
//!   buffers mark runnable.
//! - `QuicheBuffer` and `BufferLease` carry application send ownership into quiche. Quiche may split
//!   and retain those views for packetization and retransmission without copying the payload.
//! - `PacketIo` owns datagram slots and readiness. It does not interpret connections, streams, or
//!   application operations.
//!
//! A connection, one-byte send, and orderly teardown move through those layers as follows:
//!
//! 1. The application calls `EndpointCommands::try_connect`. Admission returns a `CommandReceipt`;
//!    it does not create or authenticate the connection. `Endpoint::drain_submissions` later sends
//!    the command to `Network::connect`, which allocates the local `ConnectionId`, creates the
//!    quiche state machine, and installs its CID route. A correlated
//!    `CommandResult::ConnectionCreated` reports that local allocation. `Network::queue_packets`,
//!    `PacketIo`, `Endpoint::process_io_events`, and `Network::receive` then drive the handshake.
//!    Only after quiche establishes TLS and `ConnectionState::progress` verifies the
//!    certificate-derived PID does the application receive `Completion::ConnectionEstablished`. A
//!    server follows the same packet and authentication path, but starts from an admitted Initial
//!    packet instead of a connect command.
//!
//! 2. The application calls `EndpointCommands::try_open_bidi` with the established connection.
//!    `Network::allocate_bidi` delegates to `ConnectionState`, which allocates a QUIC stream number
//!    and an empty `StreamState`. `CommandResult::StreamOpened` reports the resulting `StreamId`.
//!    Allocation is local: QUIC puts no stream on the wire until the first data or FIN reaches
//!    quiche. A peer-created bidirectional stream instead appears as `Completion::IncomingStream`
//!    when quiche reports it readable.
//!
//! 3. The application calls `SubmissionSender::try_send(stream, bytes)` with the one byte. Admission
//!    reserves queue space, one terminal completion, and the byte from the retained-send budget,
//!    then returns a `SubmissionReceipt`. The driver moves the accepted `SendSubmission` through
//!    `Network::enqueue` into the stream's ordered send queue. `ConnectionState::progress` passes a
//!    `QuicheBuffer` to `quiche::Connection::stream_send_zc`; `Network::queue_packets` later asks
//!    quiche for encrypted packets and submits them through `PacketIo`. Incoming acknowledgement
//!    packets travel back through `PacketIo` and `Network::receive` into quiche.
//!
//!    Quiche owns every split payload view needed for transmission or retransmission. When it no
//!    longer needs any view, dropping the final `QuicheBuffer` releases the retained-byte
//!    reservation; its final `BufferLease` drop also wakes the stream. The connection then emits
//!    `Completion::Send { outcome: SendOutcome::Acknowledged, .. }`. If the stream or connection
//!    fails first, the same ownership is released and the outcome is `Abandoned`. Send completions
//!    remain ordered even if quiche releases later buffers first.
//!
//! 4. To close the local send half normally, the application calls `SubmissionSender::try_finish`.
//!    The FIN is queued behind preceding sends. `Completion::Finish` reports when quiche accepts the
//!    FIN, which can occur before the preceding send's acknowledgement completion. It does not mean
//!    that the peer acknowledged the FIN or that the bidirectional stream is closed. The receive
//!    half becomes terminal when a posted receive observes peer FIN or reset, or when the application
//!    stops it. Once both halves are terminal and all queued operations and retained send views have
//!    returned, `ConnectionState` removes the stream and emits `Completion::Closed`. Reset and stop
//!    provide the corresponding abortive close for the send and receive halves.
//!
//! 5. The application calls `EndpointCommands::try_close` to close the connection.
//!    `Network::close` asks quiche to start an application close, and the correlated
//!    `CommandResult::CloseQueued` only confirms that local acceptance. Polling continues to emit and
//!    receive close packets until quiche reaches its terminal state or the driver abandons it.
//!    `Network::reap_closed` first returns every outstanding stream operation and buffer, then removes
//!    the connection and its routes, and finally emits `Completion::ConnectionClosed`. Thus the
//!    terminal connection event follows all operation completions produced while reclaiming that
//!    connection.
//!
//! `Endpoint::stage_completions` reconnects command and stream results with the completion permits
//! reserved at admission, and reserves separate event credit for unsolicited lifecycle events.
//! `Endpoint::flush_completions` preserves result order when the public completion queue is full, so
//! backpressure delays further protocol progress rather than dropping ownership or observable
//! lifecycle transitions.
