//! Bridge crate for snapshot-based mesh introspection.
//!
//! Sits above `hyperactor_mesh` (which owns live mesh topology)
//! and `monarch_distributed_telemetry` (which owns table storage).
//!
//! Currently provides:
//! - [`schema`] — relational row definitions (Arrow table shapes)
//! - [`convert`] — `NodePayload` → row projection (`ConvertedNode`)
//! - [`capture`] — BFS capture of a mesh topology into `SnapshotData`
//!
//! Ingestion orchestration is planned but not yet implemented.

pub mod capture;
pub mod convert;
